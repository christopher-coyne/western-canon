  title: "Oedipus Rex",
  introduction: `"Oedipus Rex," Sophocles' masterful Greek tragedy written around 429 BCE, tells the haunting story of Oedipus, King of Thebes, who unknowingly fulfills a terrible prophecy despite his desperate attempts to escape his fate. When a plague devastates Thebes, Oedipus vows to find the murderer of the previous king, Laius, only to discover through a series of revelations that he himself is the killerâ€”and that the man he slew was his own father. Further, he learns that he has married his mother, Jocasta, with whom he has fathered children. This devastating recognition of truth leads to Jocasta's suicide and Oedipus blinding himself in anguish. The play stands as a timeless exploration of fate versus free will, human hubris, and the consequences of seeking knowledge at any cost.`,
