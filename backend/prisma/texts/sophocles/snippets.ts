     [_Enter_ TIRESIAS _led by a young disciple. He is an old
      blind man in a prophet's robe, dark, unkempt and
      sinister in appearance._

OEDIPUS.

  Tiresias, thou whose mind divineth well
  All Truth, the spoken and the unspeakable,

[Sidenote: vv. 302-321]

  The things of heaven and them that walk the earth;
  Our city ... thou canst see, for all thy dearth
  Of outward eyes, what clouds are over her.
  In which, O gracious Lord, no minister
  Of help, no champion, can we find at all
  Save thee. For Phoebus--thou hast heard withal
  His message--to our envoy hath decreed
  One only way of help in this great need:
  To find and smite with death or banishing,
  Him who smote Laïus, our ancient King.
  Oh, grudge us nothing! Question every cry
  Of birds, and all roads else of prophecy
  Thou knowest. Save our city: save thine own
  Greatness: save me; save all that yet doth groan
  Under the dead man's wrong! Lo, in thy hand
  We lay us. And, methinks, no work so grand
  Hath man yet compassed, as, with all he can
  Of chance or power, to help his fellow man.

TIRESIAS (_to himself_).

  Ah me!
  A fearful thing is knowledge, when to know
  Helpeth no end. I knew this long ago,
  But crushed it dead. Else had I never come.

OEDIPUS.

  What means this? Comest thou so deep in gloom?

TIRESIAS.

  Let me go back! Thy work shall weigh on thee
  The less, if thou consent, and mine on me.

[Sidenote: vv. 322-336]

OEDIPUS.

  Prophet, this is not lawful; nay, nor kind
  To Thebes, who feeds thee, thus to veil thy mind.

TIRESIAS.

  'Tis that I like not thy mind, nor the way
  It goeth. Therefore, lest I also stray....

    [_He moves to go off._ OEDIPUS _bars his road._

OEDIPUS.

  Thou shalt not, knowing, turn and leave us! See,
  We all implore thee, all, on bended knee.

TIRESIAS.

  All without light!--And never light shall shine
  On this dark evil that is mine ... and thine.

OEDIPUS.

  What wilt thou? Know and speak not? In my need
  Be false to me, and let thy city bleed?

TIRESIAS.

  I will not wound myself nor thee. Why seek
  To trap and question me? I will not speak.

OEDIPUS.

  Thou devil!

    [_Movement of_ LEADER _to check him._

               Nay; the wrath of any stone
  Would rise at him. It lies with thee to have done
  And speak. Is there no melting in thine eyes!

[Sidenote: vv. 337-351]

TIRESIAS.

  Naught lies with me! With thee, with thee there lies,
  I warrant, what thou ne'er hast seen nor guessed.

OEDIPUS (_to_ LEADER, _who tries to calm him._)

  How can I hear such talk?--he maketh jest
  Of the land's woe--and keep mine anger dumb?

TIRESIAS.

  Howe'er I hold it back, 'twill come, 'twill come.

OEDIPUS.

  The more shouldst thou declare it to thy King.

TIRESIAS.

  I speak no more. For thee, if passioning
  Doth comfort thee, on, passion to thy fill!

    [_He moves to go._

OEDIPUS.

  'Fore God, I am in wrath; and speak I will,
  Nor stint what I see clear. 'Twas thou, 'twas thou,
  Didst plan this murder; aye, and, save the blow,
  Wrought it.--I know thou art blind; else I could swear
  Thou, and thou only, art the murderer.

TIRESIAS (_returning_).

  So?--I command thee by thine own word's power,
  To stand accurst, and never from this hour

[Sidenote: vv. 352-363]

  Speak word to me, nor yet to these who ring
  Thy throne. Thou art thyself the unclean thing.

OEDIPUS.

  Thou front of brass, to fling out injury
  So wild! Dost think to bate me and go free?

TIRESIAS.

  I am free. The strong truth is in this heart.

OEDIPUS.

  What prompted thee? I swear 'twas not thine art.

TIRESIAS.

  'Twas thou. I spoke not, save for thy command.

OEDIPUS.

  Spoke what? What was it? Let me understand.

TIRESIAS.

  Dost tempt me? Were my words before not plain!

OEDIPUS.

  Scarce thy full meaning. Speak the words again.

TIRESIAS.

  Thou seek'st this man of blood: Thyself art he.

OEDIPUS.

  'Twill cost thee dear, twice to have stabbed at me!

[Sidenote: vv. 364-377]

TIRESIAS.

  Shall I say more, to see thee rage again?

OEDIPUS.

  Oh, take thy fill of speech: 'twill all be vain.

TIRESIAS.

  Thou livest with those near to thee in shame
  Most deadly, seeing not thyself nor them.

OEDIPUS.

  Thou think'st 'twill help thee, thus to speak and speak?

TIRESIAS.

  Surely, until the strength of Truth be weak.

OEDIPUS.

 'Tis weak to none save thee. Thou hast no part
  In truth, thou blind man, blind eyes, ears and heart.

TIRESIAS.

  More blind, more sad thy words of scorn, which none
  Who hears but shall cast back on thee: soon, soon.

OEDIPUS.

  Thou spawn of Night, not I nor any free
  And seeing man would hurt a thing like thee.

TIRESIAS.

  God is enough.--'Tis not my doom to fall
  By thee. He knows and shall accomplish all.

[Sidenote: vv. 378-402]

OEDIPUS (_with a flash of discovery_).

  Ha! Creon!--Is it his or thine, this plot?

TIRESIAS.

 'Tis thyself hates thee. Creon hates thee not.

OEDIPUS.

  O wealth and majesty, O conquering skill
  That carved life's rebel pathways to my will,
  What is your heart but bitterness, if now
  For this poor crown Thebes bound upon my brow,
  A gift, a thing I sought not--for this crown
  Creon the stern and true, Creon mine own
  Comrade, comes creeping in the dark to ban
  And slay me; sending first this magic-man
  And schemer, this false beggar-priest, whose eye
  Is bright for gold and blind for prophecy?
  Speak, thou. When hast thou ever shown thee strong
  For aid? The She-Wolf of the woven song
  Came, and thy art could find no word, no breath,
  To save thy people from her riddling death.
  'Twas scarce a secret, that, for common men
  To unravel. There was need of Seer-craft then.
  And thou hadst none to show. No fowl, no flame,
  No God revealed it thee. 'Twas I that came,
  Rude Oedipus, unlearned in wizard's lore,
  And read her secret, and she spoke no more.
  Whom now thou thinkest to hunt out, and stand
  Foremost in honour at King Creon's hand.
  I think ye will be sorry, thou and he
  That shares thy sin-hunt. Thou dost look to me

[Sidenote: vv. 403-424]

  An old man; else, I swear this day should bring
  On thee the death thou plottest for thy King.

  JOCASTA.

  Husband, in God's name, say what hath ensued
  Of ill, that thou shouldst seek so dire a feud.

OEDIPUS.

  I will, wife. I have more regard for thee
  Than these.--Thy brother plots to murder me.

JOCASTA.

  Speak on. Make all thy charge. Only be clear.

OEDIPUS.

  He says that I am Laïus' murderer.

JOCASTA.

  Says it himself? Says he hath witnesses?

OEDIPUS.

  Nay, of himself he ventures nothing. 'Tis
  This priest, this hellish seer, makes all the tale.

JOCASTA.

  The seer?--Then tear thy terrors like a veil
  And take free breath. A seer? No human thing
  Born on the earth hath power for conjuring
  Truth from the dark of God.
                               Come, I will tell
  An old tale. There came once an oracle
  To Laïus: I say not from the God
  Himself, but from the priests and seers who trod
  His sanctuary: if ever son were bred
  From him and me, by that son's hand, it said,

[Sidenote: vv. 714-732]

  Laïus must die. And he, the tale yet stays
  Among us, at the crossing of three ways
  Was slain by robbers, strangers. And my son--
  God's mercy!--scarcely the third day was gone
  When Laïus took, and by another's hand
  Out on the desert mountain, where the land
  Is rock, cast him to die. Through both his feet
  A blade of iron they drove. Thus did we cheat
  Apollo of his will. My child could slay
  No father, and the King could cast away
  The fear that dogged him, by his child to die
  Murdered.--Behold the fruits of prophecy!
  Which heed not thou! God needs not that a seer
  Help him, when he would make his dark things clear.

OEDIPUS.

  Woman, what turmoil hath thy story wrought
  Within me! What up-stirring of old thought!

JOCASTA.

  What thought? It turns thee like a frightened thing.

OEDIPUS.

 'Twas at the crossing of three ways this King
  Was murdered? So I heard or so I thought.

JOCASTA.

  That was the tale. It is not yet forgot.

OEDIPUS.

  The crossing of three ways! And in what land?

[Sidenote: vv. 733-746]

JOCASTA.

  Phokis 'tis called. A road on either hand
  From Delphi comes and Daulia, in a glen.

OEDIPUS.

How many years and months have passed since then?

JOCASTA.

 'Twas but a little time before proclaim
  Was made of thee for king, the tidings came.

OEDIPUS.

  My God, what hast thou willed to do with me?

JOCASTA.

  Oedipus, speak! What is it troubles thee?

OEDIPUS.

  Ask me not yet. But say, what build, what height
  Had Laïus? Rode he full of youth and might?

JOCASTA.

  Tall, with the white new gleaming on his brow
  He walked. In shape just such a man as thou.

OEDIPUS.

  God help me! I much fear that I have wrought
  A curse on mine own head, and knew it not.

JOCASTA.

  How sayst thou? O my King, I look on thee
  And tremble.

[Sidenote: vv. 747-760]

OEDIPUS (_to himself_).

            Horror, if the blind can see!
  Answer but one thing and 'twill all be clear.

JOCASTA.

  Speak. I will answer though I shake with fear.

OEDIPUS.

  Went he with scant array, or a great band
  Of armèd followers, like a lord of land?

JOCASTA.

  Four men were with him, one a herald; one
  Chariot there was, where Laïus rode alone.

OEDIPUS.

  Aye me! Tis clear now.
                         Woman, who could bring
  To Thebes the story of that manslaying?

JOCASTA.

  A house-thrall, the one man they failed to slay.

OEDIPUS.

  The one man...? Is he in the house to-day?

JOCASTA.

  Indeed no. When he came that day, and found
  Thee on the throne where once sat Laïus crowned,
  He took my hand and prayed me earnestly

[Sidenote: vv. 761-779]

  To send him to the mountain heights, to be
  A herdsman, far from any sight or call
  Of Thebes. And there I sent him. 'Twas a thrall
  Good-hearted, worthy a far greater boon.

OEDIPUS.

  Canst find him? I would see this herd, and soon.

JOCASTA.

 'Tis easy. But what wouldst thou with the herd?

OEDIPUS.

  I fear mine own voice, lest it spoke a word
  Too much; whereof this man must tell me true.

JOCASTA.

  The man shall come.--My lord, methinks I too
  Should know what fear doth work thee this despite.

OEDIPUS.

  Thou shalt. When I am tossed to such an height
  Of dark foreboding, woman, when my mind
  Faceth such straits as these, where should I find
  A mightier love than thine?
                               My father--thus
  I tell thee the whole tale--was Polybus,
  In Corinth King; my mother Meropê
  Of Dorian line. And I was held to be
  The proudest in Corinthia, till one day
  A thing befell: strange was it, but no way
  Meet for such wonder and such rage as mine.
  A feast it was, and some one flushed with wine

[Sidenote: vv. 780-807]

  Cried out at me that I was no true son
  Of Polybus. Oh, I was wroth! That one
  Day I kept silence, but the morrow morn
  I sought my parents, told that tale of scorn
  And claimed the truth; and they rose in their pride
  And smote the mocker.... Aye, they satisfied
  All my desire; yet still the cavil gnawed
  My heart, and still the story crept abroad.
    At last I rose--my father knew not, nor
  My mother--and went forth to Pytho's floor
  To ask. And God in that for which I came
  Rejected me, but round me, like a flame,
  His voice flashed other answers, things of woe,
  Terror, and desolation. I must know
  My mother's body and beget thereon
  A race no mortal eye durst look upon,
  And spill in murder mine own father's blood.
    I heard, and, hearing, straight from where I stood,
  No landmark but the stars to light my way,
  Fled, fled from the dark south where Corinth lay,
  To lands far off, where never I might see
  My doom of scorn fulfilled. On bitterly
  I strode, and reached the region where, so saith
  Thy tale, that King of Thebes was struck to death....
  Wife, I will tell thee true. As one in daze
  I walked, till, at the crossing of three ways,
  A herald, like thy tale, and o'er his head
  A man behind strong horses charioted
  Met me. And both would turn me from the path,
  He and a thrall in front. And I in wrath
  Smote him that pushed me--'twas a groom who led
  The horses. Not a word the master said,

[Sidenote: vv. 808-828]

  But watched, and as I passed him on the road
  Down on my head his iron-branchèd goad
  Stabbed. But, by heaven, he rued it! In a flash
  I swung my staff and saw the old man crash
  Back from his car in blood.... Then all of them
  I slew.

  MESSENGER.

  O ye above this land in honour old
  Exalted, what a tale shall ye be told,
  What sights shall see, and tears of horror shed,
  If still your hearts be true to them that led
  Your sires! There runs no river, well I ween,
  Not Phasis nor great Ister, shall wash clean
  This house of all within that hideth--nay,
  Nor all that creepeth forth to front the day,
  Of purposed horror. And in misery
  That woundeth most which men have willed to be.

LEADER.

  No lack there was in what we knew before
  Of food for heaviness. What bring'st thou more?

MESSENGER.

  One thing I bring thee first.... 'Tis quickly said.
  Jocasta, our anointed queen, is dead.

[Sidenote: vv. 1236-1260]

LEADER.

  Unhappy woman! How came death to her?

MESSENGER.

  By her own hand.... Oh, of what passed in there
  Ye have been spared the worst. Ye cannot see.
  Howbeit, with that which still is left in me
  Of mind and memory, ye shall hear her fate.
    Like one entranced with passion, through the gate
  She passed, the white hands flashing o'er her head,
  Like blades that tear, and fled, unswerving fled,
  Toward her old bridal room, and disappeared
  And the doors crashed behind her. But we heard
  Her voice within, crying to him of old,
  Her Laïus, long dead; and things untold
  Of the old kiss unforgotten, that should bring
  The lover's death and leave the loved a thing
  Of horror, yea, a field beneath the plough
  For sire and son: then wailing bitter-low
  Across that bed of births unreconciled,
  Husband from husband born and child from child.
  And, after that, I know not how her death
  Found her. For sudden, with a roar of wrath,
  Burst Oedipus upon us. Then, I ween,
  We marked no more what passion held the Queen,
  But him, as in the fury of his stride,
  "A sword! A sword! And show me here," he cried,
  "That wife, no wife, that field of bloodstained earth
  Where husband, father, sin on sin, had birth,
  Polluted generations!" While he thus
  Raged on, some god--for sure 'twas none of us--
  Showed where she was; and with a shout away,
  As though some hand had pointed to the prey,

[Sidenote: vv. 1261-1286]

  He dashed him on the chamber door. The straight
  Door-bar of oak, it bent beneath his weight,
  Shook from its sockets free, and in he burst
  To the dark chamber.
                       There we saw her first
  Hanged, swinging from a noose, like a dead bird.
  He fell back when he saw her. Then we heard
  A miserable groan, and straight he found
  And loosed the strangling knot, and on the ground
  Laid her.--Ah, then the sight of horror came!
  The pin of gold, broad-beaten like a flame,
  He tore from off her breast, and, left and right,
  Down on the shuddering orbits of his sight
  Dashed it: "Out! Out! Ye never more shall see
  Me nor the anguish nor the sins of me.
  Ye looked on lives whose like earth never bore,
  Ye knew not those my spirit thirsted for:
  Therefore be dark for ever!"
                               Like a song
  His voice rose, and again, again, the strong
  And stabbing hand fell, and the massacred
  And bleeding eyeballs streamed upon his beard,
  Wild rain, and gouts of hail amid the rain.
    Behold affliction, yea, afflictions twain
  From man and woman broken, now made one
  In downfall. All the riches yester sun
  Saw in this house were rich in verity.
  What call ye now our riches? Agony,
  Delusion, Death, Shame, all that eye or ear
  Hath ever dreamed of misery, is here.

LEADER.

  And now how fares he? Doth the storm abate?

[Sidenote: vv. 1287-1308]

  He shouts for one to open wide the gate
  And lead him forth, and to all Thebes display
  His father's murderer, his mother's.... Nay,
  Such words I will not speak. And his intent
  Is set, to cast himself in banishment
  Out to the wild, not walk 'mid human breed
  Bearing the curse he bears. Yet sore his need
  Of strength and of some guiding hand. For sure
  He hath more burden now than man may endure.
    But see, the gates fall back, and that appears
  Which he who loathes shall pity--yea, with tears.
