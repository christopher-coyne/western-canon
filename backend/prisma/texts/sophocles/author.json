  "intro": "Sophocles is one of the three great ancient Greek tragedians whose plays have survived. Flourishing during the Golden Age of Athens, he wrote over 120 plays, though only seven survive in their entirety, including masterpieces like 'Oedipus Rex', 'Antigone', and 'Electra'. He is credited with introducing a third actor, reducing the importance of the chorus, and developing his characters with greater psychological depth than his predecessors.",
