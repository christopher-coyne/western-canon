  CHORUS.

                 _A Maiden._

From Asia, from the dayspring that uprises,
  To Bromios ever glorying we came.
We laboured for our Lord in many guises;
We toiled, but the toil is as the prize is;
  Thou Mystery, we hail thee by thy name!

                 _Another._

Who lingers in the road? Who espies us?
  He shall hide him in his house nor be bold.
Let the heart keep silence that defies us;
For I sing this day to Dionysus
  The song that is appointed from of old.

             _All the Maidens._

Oh, blessèd he in all wise,
  Who hath drunk the Living Fountain,
    Whose life no folly staineth,
      And his soul is near to God;
Whose sins are lifted, pall-wise,
  As he worships on the Mountain,
    And where Cybele ordaineth,
      Our Mother, he has trod:

      His head with ivy laden
        And his thyrsus tossing high,
          For our God he lifts his cry;
      "Up, O Bacchae, wife and maiden,
            Come, O ye Bacchae, come;
      Oh, bring the Joy-bestower,
      God-seed of God the Sower,
      Bring Bromios in his power
            From Phrygia's mountain dome;
      To street and town and tower,
            Oh, bring ye Bromios home!"

Whom erst in anguish lying
  For an unborn life's desire,
    As a dead thing in the Thunder
      His mother cast to earth;
For her heart was dying, dying,
  In the white heart of the fire;
    Till Zeus, the Lord of Wonder,
      Devised new lairs of birth;

        Yea, his own flesh tore to hide him,
          And with clasps of bitter gold
          Did a secret son enfold,
    And the Queen knew not beside him;
        Till the perfect hour was there;
    Then a hornèd God was found,
    And a God with serpents crowned;
    And for that are serpents wound
        In the wands his maidens bear,
    And the songs of serpents sound
        In the mazes of their hair.

               _Some Maidens._

All hail, O Thebes, thou nurse of Semelê!
  With Semelê's wild ivy crown thy towers;
Oh, burst in bloom of wreathing bryony,
      Berries and leaves and flowers;
    Uplift the dark divine wand,
    The oak-wand and the pine-wand,
And don thy fawn-skin, fringed in purity
      With fleecy white, like ours.

Oh, cleanse thee in the wands' waving pride!
  Yea, all men shall dance with us and pray,
When Bromios his companies shall guide
  Hillward, ever hillward, where they stay,
    The flock of the Believing,
    The maids from loom and weaving
  By the magic of his breath borne away.

                  _Others._

Hail thou, O Nurse of Zeus, O Caverned Haunt
  Where fierce arms clanged to guard God's cradle rare,
For thee of old some crested Corybant
        First woke in Cretan air
      The wild orb of our orgies,
      Our Timbrel; and thy gorges
Rang with this strain; and blended Phrygian chant
        And sweet keen pipes were there.

  But the Timbrel, the Timbrel was another's,
    And away to Mother Rhea it must wend;
  And to our holy singing from the Mother's
    The mad Satyrs carried it, to blend
        In the dancing and the cheer
        Of our third and perfect Year;
    And it serves Dionysus in the end!

                 _A Maiden._

      O glad, glad on the mountains
        To swoon in the race outworn,
          When the holy fawn-skin clings,
            And all else sweeps away,
      To the joy of the red quick fountains,
        The blood of the hill-goat torn,
          The glory of wild-beast ravenings,
            Where the hill-tops catch the day;
      To the Phrygian, Lydian, mountains!
          'Tis Bromios leads the way.

              _Another Maiden._

    Then streams the earth with milk, yea, streams
    With wine and nectar of the bee,
    And through the air dim perfume steams
    Of Syrian frankincense; and He,
    Our leader, from his thyrsus spray
    A torchlight tosses high and higher,
    A torchlight like a beacon-fire,
    To waken all that faint and stray;
    And sets them leaping as he sings,
    His tresses rippling to the sky,
    And deep beneath the Maenad cry
        His proud voice rings:
          "Come, O ye Bacchae, come!"

             _All the Maidens._

  Hither, O fragrant of Tmolus the Golden,
    Come with the voice of timbrel and drum;
  Let the cry of your joyance uplift and embolden
    The God of the joy-cry; O Bacchanals, come!
  With pealing of pipes and with Phrygian clamour,
    On, where the vision of holiness thrills,
  And the music climbs and the maddening glamour,
    With the wild White Maids, to the hills, to the hills!
  Oh, then, like a colt as he runs by a river,
    A colt by his dam, when the heart of him sings,
  With the keen limbs drawn and the fleet foot a-quiver,
          Away the Bacchanal springs!

_Enter_ TEIRESIAS. _He is an old man and blind, leaning upon a staff
    and moving with slow stateliness, though wearing the Ivy and the
    Bacchic fawn-skin._

                  TEIRESIAS.

Ho, there, who keeps the gate?--Go, summon me
Cadmus, Agênor's son, who crossed the sea
From Sidon and upreared this Theban hold.
Go, whosoe'er thou art. See he be told
Teiresias seeketh him. Himself will gauge
Mine errand, and the compact, age with age,
I vowed with him, grey hair with snow-white hair,
To deck the new God's thyrsus, and to wear
His fawn-skin, and with ivy crown our brows.

_Enter_ CADMUS _from the Castle. He is even older than_ TEIRESIAS,
    _and wears the same attire_.

                   CADMUS.

True friend! I knew that voice of thine, that flows
Like mellow wisdom from a fountain wise.
And, lo, I come prepared, in all the guise
And harness of this God. Are we not told
His is the soul of that dead life of old
That sprang from mine own daughter? Surely then
Must thou and I with all the strength of men
Exalt him.
            Where then shall I stand, where tread
The dance and toss this bowed and hoary head?
O friend, in thee is wisdom; guide my grey
And eld-worn steps, eld-worn Teiresias.--Nay;
I am not weak.

[_At the first movement of worship his manner begins to change; a
    mysterious strength and exaltation enter into him._

                  Surely this arm could smite
The wild earth with its thyrsus, day and night,
And faint not! Sweetly and forgetfully
The dim years fall from off me!

                  TEIRESIAS.

                                  As with thee,
With me 'tis likewise. Light am I and young,
And will essay the dancing and the song.

                   CADMUS.

Quick, then, our chariots to the mountain road.

                  TEIRESIAS.

Nay; to take steeds were to mistrust the God.

                   CADMUS.

So be it. Mine old arm shall guide thee there.

                  TEIRESIAS.

The God himself shall guide! Have thou no care.

                   CADMUS.

And in all Thebes shall no man dance but we?

                  TEIRESIAS.

Aye, Thebes is blinded. Thou and I can see.

                   CADMUS.

'Tis weary waiting; hold my hand, friend; so.

                  TEIRESIAS.

Lo, there is mine. So linkèd let us go.

                   CADMUS.

Shall things of dust the Gods' dark ways despise?

                  TEIRESIAS.

Or prove our wit on Heaven's high mysteries?
Not thou and I! That heritage sublime
Our sires have left us, wisdom old as time,
No word of man, how deep soe'er his thought
And won of subtlest toil, may bring to naught.
  Aye, men will rail that I forget my years,
To dance and wreathe with ivy these white hairs;
What recks it? Seeing the God no line hath told
To mark what man shall dance, or young or old;
But craves his honours from mortality
All, no man marked apart; and great shall be!

  CADMUS (_after looking away toward the Mountain_).

Teiresias, since this light thou canst not read,
I must be seer for thee. Here comes in speed
Pentheus, Echîon's son, whom I have raised
To rule my people in my stead.--Amazed
He seems. Stand close, and mark what we shall hear.
  `,
  analysis: `After Dionysus delivers his prologue, his devoted followers, the Chorus of Asian Bacchanals, arrive in Thebes. Their song expresses the core tenets and ecstatic joy of their worship. Soon after, the old blind prophet Teiresias and the former king Cadmus, grandfather of Pentheus, appear, surprisingly dressed in Bacchic attire, ready to join the worship despite their age.`,

  [_Enter suddenly and in haste a Messenger from the Mountain._

                  MESSENGER.

Great Pentheus, Lord of all this Theban land,
I come from high Kithaeron, where the frore
Snow spangles gleam and cease not evermore. . .

                  PENTHEUS.

And what of import may thy coming bring?

                  MESSENGER.

I have seen the Wild White Women there, O King,
Whose fleet limbs darted arrow-like but now
From Thebes away, and come to tell thee how
They work strange deeds and passing marvel. Yet
I first would learn thy pleasure. Shall I set
My whole tale forth, or veil the stranger part?
Yea, Lord, I fear the swiftness of thy heart,
Thine edgèd wrath and more than royal soul.

                  PENTHEUS.

Thy tale shall nothing scathe thee.--Tell the whole.
It skills not to be wroth with honesty.
Nay, if thy news of them be dark, 'tis he
Shall pay it, who bewitched and led them on.

                  MESSENGER.

Our herded kine were moving in the dawn
Up to the peaks, the greyest, coldest time,
When the first rays steal earthward, and the rime
Yields, when I saw three bands of them. The one
Autonoë led, one Ino, one thine own
Mother, Agâvê. There beneath the trees
Sleeping they lay, like wild things flung at ease
In the forest; one half sinking on a bed
Of deep pine greenery; one with careless head
Amid the fallen oak leaves; all most cold
In purity--not as thy tale was told
Of wine-cups and wild music and the chase
For love amid the forest's loneliness.
Then rose the Queen Agâvê suddenly
Amid her band, and gave the God's wild cry,
"Awake, ye Bacchanals! I hear the sound
Of hornèd kine. Awake ye!"--Then, all round,
Alert, the warm sleep fallen from their eyes,
A marvel of swift ranks I saw them rise,
Dames young and old, and gentle maids unwed
Among them. O'er their shoulders first they shed
Their tresses, and caught up the fallen fold
Of mantles where some clasp had loosened hold,
And girt the dappled fawn-skins in with long
Quick snakes that hissed and writhed with quivering tongue.
And one a young fawn held, and one a wild
Wolf cub, and fed them with white milk, and smiled
In love, young mothers with a mother's breast
And babes at home forgotten! Then they pressed
Wreathed ivy round their brows, and oaken sprays
And flowering bryony. And one would raise
Her wand and smite the rock, and straight a jet
Of quick bright water came. Another set
Her thyrsus in the bosomed earth, and there
Was red wine that the God sent up to her,
A darkling fountain. And if any lips
Sought whiter draughts, with dipping finger-tips
They pressed the sod, and gushing from the ground
Came springs of milk. And reed-wands ivy-crowned
Ran with sweet honey, drop by drop.--O King,
Hadst thou been there, as I, and seen this thing,
With prayer and most high wonder hadst thou gone
To adore this God whom now thou rail'st upon!
  Howbeit, the kine-wardens and shepherds straight
Came to one place, amazed, and held debate;
And one being there who walked the streets and scanned
The ways of speech, took lead of them whose hand
Knew but the slow soil and the solemn hill,
And flattering spoke, and asked: "Is it your will,
Masters, we stay the mother of the King,
Agâvê, from her lawless worshipping,
And win us royal thanks?"--And this seemed good
To all; and through the branching underwood
We hid us, cowering in the leaves. And there
Through the appointed hour they made their prayer
And worship of the Wand, with one accord
Of heart and cry--"Iacchos, Bromios, Lord,
God of God born!"--And all the mountain felt,
And worshipped with them; and the wild things knelt
And ramped and gloried, and the wilderness
Was filled with moving voices and dim stress.
  Soon, as it chanced, beside my thicket-close
The Queen herself passed dancing, and I rose
And sprang to seize her. But she turned her face
Upon me: "Ho, my rovers of the chase,
My wild White Hounds, we are hunted! Up, each rod
And follow, follow, for our Lord and God!"
Thereat, for fear they tear us, all we fled
Amazed; and on, with hand unweaponèd
They swept toward our herds that browsed the green
Hill grass. Great uddered kine then hadst thou seen
Bellowing in sword-like hands that cleave and tear,
A live steer riven asunder, and the air
Tossed with rent ribs or limbs of cloven tread,
And flesh upon the branches, and a red
Rain from the deep green pines. Yea, bulls of pride,
Horns swift to rage, were fronted and aside
Flung stumbling, by those multitudinous hands
Dragged pitilessly. And swifter were the bands
Of garbèd flesh and bone unbound withal
Than on thy royal eyes the lids may fall.
  Then on like birds, by their own speed upborne,
They swept toward the plains of waving corn
That lie beside Asopus' banks, and bring
To Thebes the rich fruit of her harvesting.
On Hysiae and Erythrae that lie nursed
Amid Kithaeron's bowering rocks, they burst
Destroying, as a foeman's army comes.
They caught up little children from their homes,
High on their shoulders, babes unheld, that swayed
And laughed and fell not; all a wreck they made;
Yea, bronze and iron did shatter, and in play
Struck hither and thither, yet no wound had they;
Caught fire from out the hearths, yea, carried hot
Flames in their tresses and were scorchèd not!
  The village folk in wrath took spear and sword,
And turned upon the Bacchae. Then, dread Lord,
The wonder was. For spear nor barbèd brand
Could scathe nor touch the damsels; but the Wand,
The soft and wreathèd wand their white hands sped,
Blasted those men and quelled them, and they fled
Dizzily. Sure some God was in these things!
  And the holy women back to those strange springs
Returned, that God had sent them when the day
Dawned, on the upper heights; and washed away
The stain of battle. And those girdling snakes
Hissed out to lap the waterdrops from cheeks
And hair and breast.
                      Therefore I counsel thee,
O King, receive this Spirit, whoe'er he be,
To Thebes in glory. Greatness manifold
Is all about him; and the tale is told
That this is he who first to man did give
The grief-assuaging vine. Oh, let him live;
For if he die, then Love herself is slain,
And nothing joyous in the world again!
  `,
  analysis: `Pentheus has scorned the worship of Dionysus and imprisoned the god (disguised as a mortal priest). A messenger, a herdsman from Mount Kithaeron, arrives with a disturbing and wondrous report of what he witnessed among the Theban women – including Pentheus's mother Agave – who have fled to the mountains.`,

  _Enter hastily a_ MESSENGER _from the Mountain, pale and distraught_.

                  MESSENGER.

Woe to the house once blest in Hellas! Woe
To thee, old King Sidonian, who didst sow
The dragon-seed on Ares' bloody lea!
Alas, even thy slaves must weep for thee!

                   LEADER.

News from the mountain?--Speak! How hath it sped?

                  MESSENGER.

Pentheus, my king, Echîon's son, is dead!

                   LEADER.

          All hail, God of the Voice,
            Manifest ever more!

                  MESSENGER.

What say'st thou?--And how strange thy tone, as though
In joy at this my master's overthrow!

                   LEADER.

          With fierce joy I rejoice,
            Child of a savage shore;
For the chains of my prison are broken, and the dread where I cowered
    of yore!

                  MESSENGER.

And deem'st thou Thebes so beggared, so forlorn
Of manhood, as to sit beneath thy scorn?

                   LEADER.

          Thebes hath o'er me no sway!
          None save Him I obey,
Dionysus, Child of the Highest, Him I obey and adore!

                  MESSENGER.

One can forgive thee!--Yet 'tis no fair thing,
Maids, to rejoice in a man's suffering.

                   LEADER.

          Speak of the mountain side!
          Tell us the doom he died,
The sinner smitten to death, even where his sin was sore!

                  MESSENGER.

We climbed beyond the utmost habitings
Of Theban shepherds, passed Asopus' springs,
And struck into the land of rock on dim
Kithaeron--Pentheus, and, attending him,
I, and the Stranger who should guide our way.
Then first in a green dell we stopped, and lay,
Lips dumb and feet unmoving, warily
Watching, to be unseen and yet to see.
  A narrow glen it was, by crags o'ertowered,
Torn through by tossing waters, and there lowered
A shadow of great pines over it. And there
The Maenad maidens sate; in toil they were,
Busily glad. Some with an ivy chain
Tracked a worn wand to toss its locks again;
Some, wild in joyance, like young steeds set free,
Made answering songs of mystic melody.
  But my poor master saw not the great band
Before him. "Stranger," cried he, "where we stand
Mine eyes can reach not these false saints of thine.
Mount we the bank, or some high-shouldered pine,
And I shall see their follies clear!" At that
There came a marvel. For the Stranger straight
Touched a great pine-tree's high and heavenward crown,
And lower, lower, lower, urged it down
To the herbless floor. Round like a bending bow,
Or slow wheel's rim a joiner forces to,
So in those hands that tough and mountain stem
Bowed slow--oh, strength not mortal dwelt in them!--
To the very earth. And there he set the King,
And slowly, lest it cast him in its spring,
Let back the young and straining tree, till high
It towered again amid the towering sky;
And Pentheus in the branches! Well, I ween,
He saw the Maenads then, and well was seen!
For scarce was he aloft, when suddenly
There was no Stranger any more with me,
But out of Heaven a Voice--oh, what voice else?--
'Twas He that called! "Behold, O damosels,
I bring ye him who turneth to despite
Both me and ye, and darkeneth my great Light.
'Tis yours to avenge!" So spake he, and there came
'Twixt earth and sky a pillar of high flame.
And silence took the air, and no leaf stirred
In all the forest dell. Thou hadst not heard
In that vast silence any wild thing's cry.
And up they sprang; but with bewildered eye,
Agaze and listening, scarce yet hearing true.
Then came the Voice again. And when they knew
Their God's clear call, old Cadmus' royal brood,
Up, like wild pigeons startled in a wood,
On flying feet they came, his mother blind,
Agâvê, and her sisters, and behind
All the wild crowd, more deeply maddened then,
Through the angry rocks and torrent-tossing glen,
Until they spied him in the dark pine-tree:
Then climbed a crag hard by and furiously
Some sought to stone him, some their wands would fling
Lance-wise aloft, in cruel targeting.
But none could strike. The height o'ertopped their rage,
And there he clung, unscathed, as in a cage
Caught. And of all their strife no end was found.
Then, "Hither," cried Agâvê; "stand we round
And grip the stem, my Wild Ones, till we take
This climbing cat-o'-the-mount! He shall not make
A tale of God's high dances!" Out then shone
Arm upon arm, past count, and closed upon
The pine, and gripped; and the ground gave, and down
It reeled. And that high sitter from the crown
Of the green pine-top, with a shrieking cry
Fell, as his mind grew clear, and there hard by
Was horror visible. 'Twas his mother stood
O'er him, first priestess of those rites of blood.
He tore the coif, and from his head away
Flung it, that she might know him, and not slay
To her own misery. He touched the wild
Cheek, crying: "Mother, it is I, thy child,
Thy Pentheus, born thee in Echîon's hall!
Have mercy, Mother! Let it not befall
Through sin of mine, that thou shouldst slay thy son!"
  But she, with lips a-foam and eyes that run
Like leaping fire, with thoughts that ne'er should be
On earth, possessed by Bacchios utterly,
Stays not nor hears. Round his left arm she put
Both hands, set hard against his side her foot,
Drew . . . and the shoulder severed!--Not by might
Of arm, but easily, as the God made light
Her hand's essay. And at the other side
Was Ino rending; and the torn flesh cried,
And on Autonoë pressed, and all the crowd
Of ravening arms. Yea, all the air was loud
With groans that faded into sobbing breath,
Dim shrieks, and joy, and triumph-cries of death.
And here was borne a severed arm, and there
A hunter's booted foot; white bones lay bare
With rending; and swift hands ensanguinèd
Tossed as in sport the flesh of Pentheus dead.
  His body lies afar. The precipice
Hath part, and parts in many an interstice
Lurk of the tangled woodland--no light quest
To find. And, ah, the head! Of all the rest,
His mother hath it, pierced upon a wand,
As one might pierce a lion's, and through the land,
Leaving her sisters in their dancing place,
Bears it on high! Yea, to these walls her face
Was set, exulting in her deed of blood,
Calling upon her Bromios, her God,
Her Comrade, Fellow-Render of the Prey,
Her All-Victorious, to whom this day
She bears in triumph . . . her own broken heart!
  For me, after that sight, I will depart
Before Agâvê comes.--Oh, to fulfil
God's laws, and have no thought beyond His will,
Is man's best treasure. Aye, and wisdom true,
Methinks, for things of dust to cleave unto!

                 The_ MESSENGER _departs into the Castle
  `,
  analysis: `Persuaded and seemingly hypnotized by Dionysus, Pentheus has dressed as a female Bacchanal and gone to spy on the Maenads on Mount Kithaeron.
