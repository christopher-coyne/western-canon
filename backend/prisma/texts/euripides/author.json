  "intro": "Euripides was the last of the three great tragedians of classical Athens. He is known for his innovative and often challenging plays that explored the darker, more irrational aspects of human nature, questioned traditional myths and values, and featured strong, complex female characters and sympathetic portrayals of marginalized groups. Eighteen of his roughly ninety plays survive, including 'Medea', 'The Bacchae', and 'Trojan Women'.",
