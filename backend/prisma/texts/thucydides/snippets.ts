  “Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are
rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration
favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a
democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in
their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public
life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being
allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if
a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity
of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends
also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous
surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry
with our neighbour for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those
injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they
inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations
does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief
safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws,
particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they
are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which,
although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.

“Further, we provide plenty of means for the mind to refresh itself
from business. We celebrate games and sacrifices all the year round,
and the elegance of our private establishments forms a daily source of
pleasure and helps to banish the spleen; while the magnitude of our
city draws the produce of the world into our harbour, so that to the
Athenian the fruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as
those of his own.

“If we turn to our military policy, there also we differ from our
antagonists. We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien
acts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing,
although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our
liberality; trusting less in system and policy than to the native
spirit of our citizens; while in education, where our rivals from their
very cradles by a painful discipline seek after manliness, at Athens we
live exactly as we please, and yet are just as ready to encounter every
legitimate danger. In proof of this it may be noticed that the
Lacedaemonians do not invade our country alone, but bring with them all
their confederates; while we Athenians advance unsupported into the
territory of a neighbour, and fighting upon a foreign soil usually
vanquish with ease men who are defending their homes. Our united force
was never yet encountered by any enemy, because we have at once to
attend to our marine and to dispatch our citizens by land upon a
hundred different services; so that, wherever they engage with some
such fraction of our strength, a success against a detachment is
magnified into a victory over the nation, and a defeat into a reverse
suffered at the hands of our entire people. And yet if with habits not
of labour but of ease, and courage not of art but of nature, we are
still willing to encounter danger, we have the double advantage of
escaping the experience of hardships in anticipation and of facing them
in the hour of need as fearlessly as those who are never free from
them.

“Nor are these the only points in which our city is worthy of
admiration. We cultivate refinement without extravagance and knowledge
without effeminacy; wealth we employ more for use than for show, and
place the real disgrace of poverty not in owning to the fact but in
declining the struggle against it. Our public men have, besides
politics, their private affairs to attend to, and our ordinary
citizens, though occupied with the pursuits of industry, are still fair
judges of public matters; for, unlike any other nation, regarding him
who takes no part in these duties not as unambitious but as useless, we
Athenians are able to judge at all events if we cannot originate, and,
instead of looking on discussion as a stumbling-block in the way of
action, we think it an indispensable preliminary to any wise action at
all. Again, in our enterprises we present the singular spectacle of
daring and deliberation, each carried to its highest point, and both
united in the same persons; although usually decision is the fruit of
ignorance, hesitation of reflection. But the palm of courage will
surely be adjudged most justly to those, who best know the difference
between hardship and pleasure and yet are never tempted to shrink from
danger. In generosity we are equally singular, acquiring our friends by
conferring, not by receiving, favours. Yet, of course, the doer of the
favour is the firmer friend of the two, in order by continued kindness
to keep the recipient in his debt; while the debtor feels less keenly
from the very consciousness that the return he makes will be a payment,
not a free gift. And it is only the Athenians, who, fearless of
consequences, confer their benefits not from calculations of
expediency, but in the confidence of liberality.

“In short, I say that as a city we are the school of Hellas, while I
doubt if the world can produce a man who, where he has only himself to
depend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a
versatility, as the Athenian. And that this is no mere boast thrown out
for the occasion, but plain matter of fact, the power of the state
acquired by these habits proves. For Athens alone of her contemporaries
is found when tested to be greater than her reputation, and alone gives
no occasion to her assailants to blush at the antagonist by whom they
have been worsted, or to her subjects to question her title by merit to
rule. Rather, the admiration of the present and succeeding ages will be
ours, since we have not left our power without witness, but have shown
it by mighty proofs; and far from needing a Homer for our panegyrist,
or other of his craft whose verses might charm for the moment only for
the impression which they gave to melt at the touch of fact, we have
forced every sea and land to be the highway of our daring, and
everywhere, whether for evil or for good, have left imperishable
monuments behind us. Such is the Athens for which these men, in the
assertion of their resolve not to lose her, nobly fought and died; and
well may every one of their survivors be ready to suffer in her cause.

  It first began, it is said, in the parts of Ethiopia above Egypt, and
thence descended into Egypt and Libya and into most of the King’s
country. Suddenly falling upon Athens, it first attacked the population
in Piraeus—which was the occasion of their saying that the
Peloponnesians had poisoned the reservoirs, there being as yet no wells
there—and afterwards appeared in the upper city, when the deaths became
much more frequent. All speculation as to its origin and its causes, if
causes can be found adequate to produce so great a disturbance, I leave
to other writers, whether lay or professional; for myself, I shall
simply set down its nature, and explain the symptoms by which perhaps
it may be recognized by the student, if it should ever break out again.
This I can the better do, as I had the disease myself, and watched its
operation in the case of others.

That year then is admitted to have been otherwise unprecedentedly free
from sickness; and such few cases as occurred all determined in this.
As a rule, however, there was no ostensible cause; but people in good
health were all of a sudden attacked by violent heats in the head, and
redness and inflammation in the eyes, the inward parts, such as the
throat or tongue, becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid
breath. These symptoms were followed by sneezing and hoarseness, after
which the pain soon reached the chest, and produced a hard cough. When
it fixed in the stomach, it upset it; and discharges of bile of every
kind named by physicians ensued, accompanied by very great distress. In
most cases also an ineffectual retching followed, producing violent
spasms, which in some cases ceased soon after, in others much later.
Externally the body was not very hot to the touch, nor pale in its
appearance, but reddish, livid, and breaking out into small pustules
and ulcers. But internally it burned so that the patient could not bear
to have on him clothing or linen even of the very lightest description;
or indeed to be otherwise than stark naked. What they would have liked
best would have been to throw themselves into cold water; as indeed was
done by some of the neglected sick, who plunged into the rain-tanks in
their agonies of unquenchable thirst; though it made no difference
whether they drank little or much. Besides this, the miserable feeling
of not being able to rest or sleep never ceased to torment them. The
body meanwhile did not waste away so long as the distemper was at its
height, but held out to a marvel against its ravages; so that when they
succumbed, as in most cases, on the seventh or eighth day to the
internal inflammation, they had still some strength in them. But if
they passed this stage, and the disease descended further into the
bowels, inducing a violent ulceration there accompanied by severe
diarrhoea, this brought on a weakness which was generally fatal. For
the disorder first settled in the head, ran its course from thence
through the whole of the body, and, even where it did not prove mortal,
it still left its mark on the extremities; for it settled in the privy
parts, the fingers and the toes, and many escaped with the loss of
these, some too with that of their eyes. Others again were seized with
an entire loss of memory on their first recovery, and did not know
either themselves or their friends.

But while the nature of the distemper was such as to baffle all
description, and its attacks almost too grievous for human nature to
endure, it was still in the following circumstance that its difference
from all ordinary disorders was most clearly shown. All the birds and
beasts that prey upon human bodies, either abstained from touching them
(though there were many lying unburied), or died after tasting them. In
proof of this, it was noticed that birds of this kind actually
disappeared; they were not about the bodies, or indeed to be seen at
all. But of course the effects which I have mentioned could best be
studied in a domestic animal like the dog.

Such then, if we pass over the varieties of particular cases which were
many and peculiar, were the general features of the distemper.
Meanwhile the town enjoyed an immunity from all the ordinary disorders;
or if any case occurred, it ended in this. Some died in neglect, others
in the midst of every attention. No remedy was found that could be used
as a specific; for what did good in one case, did harm in another.
Strong and weak constitutions proved equally incapable of resistance,
all alike being swept away, although dieted with the utmost precaution.
By far the most terrible feature in the malady was the dejection which
ensued when any one felt himself sickening, for the despair into which
they instantly fell took away their power of resistance, and left them
a much easier prey to the disorder; besides which, there was the awful
spectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught the infection
in nursing each other. This caused the greatest mortality. On the one
hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished from
neglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a
nurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the
consequence. This was especially the case with such as made any
pretensions to goodness: honour made them unsparing of themselves in
their attendance in their friends’ houses, where even the members of
the family were at last worn out by the moans of the dying, and
succumbed to the force of the disaster. Yet it was with those who had
recovered from the disease that the sick and the dying found most
compassion. These knew what it was from experience, and had now no fear
for themselves; for the same man was never attacked twice—never at
least fatally. And such persons not only received the congratulations
of others, but themselves also, in the elation of the moment, half
entertained the vain hope that they were for the future safe from any
disease whatsoever.

An aggravation of the existing calamity was the influx from the country
into the city, and this was especially felt by the new arrivals. As
there were no houses to receive them, they had to be lodged at the hot
season of the year in stifling cabins, where the mortality raged
without restraint. The bodies of dying men lay one upon another, and
half-dead creatures reeled about the streets and gathered round all the
fountains in their longing for water. The sacred places also in which
they had quartered themselves were full of corpses of persons that had
died there, just as they were; for as the disaster passed all bounds,
men, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of
everything, whether sacred or profane. All the burial rites before in
use were entirely upset, and they buried the bodies as best they could.
Many from want of the proper appliances, through so many of their
friends having died already, had recourse to the most shameless
sepultures: sometimes getting the start of those who had raised a pile,
they threw their own dead body upon the stranger’s pyre and ignited it;
sometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying on the top of
another that was burning, and so went off.

Nor was this the only form of lawless extravagance which owed its
origin to the plague. Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly
done in a corner, and not just as they pleased, seeing the rapid
transitions produced by persons in prosperity suddenly dying and those
who before had nothing succeeding to their property. So they resolved
to spend quickly and enjoy themselves, regarding their lives and riches
as alike things of a day. Perseverance in what men called honour was
popular with none, it was so uncertain whether they would be spared to
attain the object; but it was settled that present enjoyment, and all
that contributed to it, was both honourable and useful. Fear of gods or
law of man there was none to restrain them. As for the first, they
judged it to be just the same whether they worshipped them or not, as
they saw all alike perishing; and for the last, no one expected to live
to be brought to trial for his offences, but each felt that a far
severer sentence had been already passed upon them all and hung ever
over their heads, and before this fell it was only reasonable to enjoy
life a little.

  In the second year of the war, shortly after the Peloponnesians invade Attica again, a devastating plague strikes Athens, now overcrowded with refugees from the countryside. Thucydides, who contracted the disease himself, provides a detailed and harrowing account of its physical symptoms and its profound impact on Athenian society and morale.

  So bloody was the march of the revolution, and the impression which it
made was the greater as it was one of the first to occur. Later on, one
may say, the whole Hellenic world was convulsed; struggles being every,
where made by the popular chiefs to bring in the Athenians, and by the
oligarchs to introduce the Lacedaemonians. In peace there would have
been neither the pretext nor the wish to make such an invitation; but
in war, with an alliance always at the command of either faction for
the hurt of their adversaries and their own corresponding advantage,
opportunities for bringing in the foreigner were never wanting to the
revolutionary parties. The sufferings which revolution entailed upon
the cities were many and terrible, such as have occurred and always
will occur, as long as the nature of mankind remains the same; though
in a severer or milder form, and varying in their symptoms, according
to the variety of the particular cases. In peace and prosperity, states
and individuals have better sentiments, because they do not find
themselves suddenly confronted with imperious necessities; but war
takes away the easy supply of daily wants, and so proves a rough
master, that brings most men’s characters to a level with their
fortunes. Revolution thus ran its course from city to city, and the
places which it arrived at last, from having heard what had been done
before, carried to a still greater excess the refinement of their
inventions, as manifested in the cunning of their enterprises and the
atrocity of their reprisals. Words had to change their ordinary meaning
and to take that which was now given them. Reckless audacity came to be
considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious
cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability
to see all sides of a question, inaptness to act on any. Frantic
violence became the attribute of manliness; cautious plotting, a
justifiable means of self-defence. The advocate of extreme measures was
always trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected. To succeed in a
plot was to have a shrewd head, to divine a plot a still shrewder; but
to try to provide against having to do either was to break up your
party and to be afraid of your adversaries. In fine, to forestall an
intending criminal, or to suggest the idea of a crime where it was
wanting, was equally commended until even blood became a weaker tie
than party, from the superior readiness of those united by the latter
to dare everything without reserve; for such associations had not in
view the blessings derivable from established institutions but were
formed by ambition for their overthrow; and the confidence of their
members in each other rested less on any religious sanction than upon
complicity in crime. The fair proposals of an adversary were met with
jealous precautions by the stronger of the two, and not with a generous
confidence. Revenge also was held of more account than
self-preservation. Oaths of reconciliation, being only proffered on
either side to meet an immediate difficulty, only held good so long as
no other weapon was at hand; but when opportunity offered, he who first
ventured to seize it and to take his enemy off his guard, thought this
perfidious vengeance sweeter than an open one, since, considerations of
safety apart, success by treachery won him the palm of superior
intelligence. Indeed it is generally the case that men are readier to
call rogues clever than simpletons honest, and are as ashamed of being
the second as they are proud of being the first. The cause of all these
evils was the lust for power arising from greed and ambition; and from
these passions proceeded the violence of parties once engaged in
contention. The leaders in the cities, each provided with the fairest
professions, on the one side with the cry of political equality of the
people, on the other of a moderate aristocracy, sought prizes for
themselves in those public interests which they pretended to cherish,
and, recoiling from no means in their struggles for ascendancy engaged
in the direst excesses; in their acts of vengeance they went to even
greater lengths, not stopping at what justice or the good of the state
demanded, but making the party caprice of the moment their only
standard, and invoking with equal readiness the condemnation of an
unjust verdict or the authority of the strong arm to glut the
animosities of the hour. Thus religion was in honour with neither
party; but the use of fair phrases to arrive at guilty ends was in high
reputation. Meanwhile the moderate part of the citizens perished
between the two, either for not joining in the quarrel, or because envy
would not suffer them to escape.

Thus every form of iniquity took root in the Hellenic countries by
reason of the troubles. The ancient simplicity into which honour so
largely entered was laughed down and disappeared; and society became
divided into camps in which no man trusted his fellow. To put an end to
this, there was neither promise to be depended upon, nor oath that
could command respect; but all parties dwelling rather in their
calculation upon the hopelessness of a permanent state of things, were
more intent upon self-defence than capable of confidence. In this
contest the blunter wits were most successful. Apprehensive of their
own deficiencies and of the cleverness of their antagonists, they
feared to be worsted in debate and to be surprised by the combinations
of their more versatile opponents, and so at once boldly had recourse
to action: while their adversaries, arrogantly thinking that they
should know in time, and that it was unnecessary to secure by action
what policy afforded, often fell victims to their want of precaution.
