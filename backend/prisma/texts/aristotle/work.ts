  title: "Poetics",
  introduction: `"Poetics," written by Aristotle around 335 BCE, represents the first systematic analysis of literary theory and dramatic criticism in Western thought. In this influential treatise, Aristotle examines the nature and components of tragedy, establishing foundational concepts that continue to shape our understanding of drama and narrative. He introduces the notion of mimesis (imitation of reality), identifies plot as the "soul of tragedy," and articulates his famous theory of catharsisâ€”the purging of emotions through witnessing dramatic events. Aristotle methodically dissects the elements of successful tragedy, including character, thought, diction, melody, and spectacle, while comparing tragedy to epic poetry and offering judgments on the works of playwrights like Sophocles and Euripides. Though the surviving text is incomplete and likely represents lecture notes rather than a finished work, "Poetics" remains a cornerstone of literary criticism that has profoundly influenced creative expression across centuries, offering timeless insights into what makes storytelling powerful and meaningful.`,
