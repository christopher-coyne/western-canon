  introduction:
    "The Iliad, attributed to Homer, is an epic poem that plunges into the heart of the Trojan War, focusing not on the ten-year conflict as a whole, but on a crucial, wrath-fueled episode within it. The poem centers around the rage of Achilles, the mightiest of the Greek warriors, and its devastating consequences for both the Achaean and Trojan armies. Through vivid battles, divine interventions, and deeply human characters, the Iliad explores timeless themes of honor, glory, fate, and the profound costs of war, offering a powerful and enduring reflection on the complexities of human nature and the epic struggle between mortals and gods in a world defined by both heroism and tragedy.",
