  title: "The Frogs",
  introduction: `"The Frogs," a wildly inventive comedy by Aristophanes performed in Athens in 405 BCE, follows the god Dionysus as he journeys to the underworld to retrieve his favorite playwright, Euripides, who has recently died. Accompanied by his slave Xanthias, Dionysus disguises himself as Heracles and endures a series of absurd misadventures, including the titular chorus of frogs who mock him during his crossing of the Styx. The plot takes a surprising literary turn when Dionysus discovers a heated competition in Hades between Euripides and the older tragedian Aeschylus for the title of greatest dramatist. What ensues is a brilliant satirical debate about poetry, politics, and moral education, with each playwright defending his artistic merits while attacking the other's style and influence on Athenian society. Written during Athens' desperate final years in the Peloponnesian War, the play blends outrageous comedy with serious cultural criticism, ultimately suggesting that great art must serve both aesthetic and civic purposesâ€”a message that secured "The Frogs" the rare honor of a second performance in ancient Athens.`,
