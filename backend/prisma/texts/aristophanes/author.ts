  intro:
    "Aristophanes was the foremost comic playwright of ancient Athens, often called the 'Father of Comedy'. His works represent the only surviving examples of Old Comedy, characterized by sharp political satire, social commentary, fantastical plots, and often obscene humor. Eleven of his forty plays survive, including 'Lysistrata', 'The Clouds', and 'The Frogs', offering invaluable insights into Athenian life and politics.",
