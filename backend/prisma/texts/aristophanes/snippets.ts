  XANTHIAS

  Shall I crack any of those old jokes, master,
  At which the audience never fail to laugh?

  DIONYSUS.
  
  Aye, what you will, except _I'm getting crushed:_ Fight shy
  of that: I'm sick of that already.

  XAN.
  
  Nothing else smart?

  DIO.
  
  Aye, save _my shoulder's aching._

  XAN.
  
  Come now, that comical joke?

  DIO.
  
  With all my heart. Only be careful not to shift your pole,
  And--

  XAN.
  
  What?

  DIO.
  
  And vow that you've a bellyache.

  XAN.
  
  May I not say I'm overburdened so
  That if none ease me, I must ease myself?

  DIO. For mercy's sake, not till I'm going to vomit.

  XAN.

  What! must I bear these burdens, and not make
  One of the jokes Ameipsias and Lycis
  And Phrynichus, in every play they write,
  Put in the mouths of all their burden-bearers?

  DIO.

  Don't make them; no! I tell you when I see
  Their plays, and hear those jokes, I come away
  More than a twelvemonth older than I went.

  XAN.

  O thrice unlucky neck of mine, which now
  Is _getting crushed_, yet must not crack its joke!

  DIO.

  Now is not this fine pampered insolence
  When I myself, Dionysus, son of--Pipkin,
  Toil on afoot, and let this fellow ride,
  Taking no trouble, and no burden bearing?

  XAN. What, don't I bear?

  DIO. How can you when you're riding?

  XAN. Why, I bear these.

  DIO. How?

  XAN. Most unwillingly.

  DIO. Does not the donkey bear the load you're bearing?

  XAN. Not what I bear myself: by Zeus, not he.

  DIO. How can you bear, when you are borne yourself?

  XAN. Don't know: but anyhow _my shoulder's aching_.

  DIO.

  Then since you say the donkey helps you not,
  You lift him up and carry him in turn.

  XAN.

  O hang it all! why didn't I fight at sea?
  You should have smarted bitterly for this.

  DIO.

  Get down, you rascal; I've been trudging on
  Till now I've reached the portal, where I'm going
  First to turn in.
  Boy! Boy! I say there, Boy!

  HERACLES.

  Who banged the door? How like a prancing Centaur
  He drove against it! Mercy o' me, what's this?

  DIO. Boy.

  XAN. Yes.

  DIO. Did you observe?

  XAN. What?

  DIO. How alarmed He is.

  XAN. Aye truly, lest you've lost your wits.

  HER. O by Demeter, I can't choose but laugh.
  Biting my lips won't stop me. Ha! ha! ha!

  DIO. Pray you, come hither, I have need of you.

  HER. I vow I can't help laughing, I can't help it.
  A lion's hide upon a yellow silk, a club and buskin!
  What's it all about? Where were you going?

  DIO. I was serving lately aboard the--Cleisthenes.

  HER. And fought?

  DIO. And sank more than a dozen of the enemy's ships.

  HER. You two?

  DIO. We two.

  HER. And then I awoke, and lo!

  DIO. There as, on deck, I'm reading to myself
  The Andromeda, a sudden pang of longing
  Shoots through my heart, you can't conceive how keenly.

  HER. How big a pang.

  DIO. A small one, Molon's size.

  HER. Caused by a woman?

  DIO. No.

  HER. A boy?

  DIO. No, no.

  HER. A man?

  DIO. Ah! ah!

  HER. Was it for Cleisthenes?

  DIO. Don't mock me, brother; on my life I am
  In a bad way: such fierce desire consumes me.

  HER. Aye, little brother? how?

  DIO. I can't describe it. But yet I'll tell you in a riddling way.
  Have you e'er felt a sudden lust for soup?

  HER. Soup! Zeus-a-mercy, yes, ten thousand times.

  DIO. Is the thing clear, or must I speak again?

  HER. Not of the soup: I'm clear about the soup.

  DIO. Well, just that sort of pang devours my heart
  For lost Euripides.

  HER. A dead man too.

  DIO. And no one shall persuade me not to go after the man.

  HER. Do you mean below, to Hades?

  DIO. And lower still, if there's a lower still.

  HER. What on earth for?

  DIO. I want a genuine poet, "For some are not, and those that are, are
  bad."

  HER. What! does not Iophon live?

  DIO. Well, he's the sole Good thing remaining, if even he is good.
  For even of that I'm not exactly certain.

  HER. If go you must, there's Sophocles--he comes Before Euripides--why
  not take _him_?

  DIO. Not till I've tried if Iophon's coin rings true
  When he's alone, apart from Sophocles.
  Besides, Euripides the crafty rogue,
  Will find a thousand shifts to get away,
  But _he_ was easy here, is easy there.

  HER. But Agathon, where is he?

  DIO. He has gone and left us, A genial poet, by his friends much
  missed.

  HER. Gone where?

  DIO. To join the blessed in their banquets.

  HER. But what of Xenocles?

  DIO. O he be hanged!

  HER. Pythangelus?

  XAN. But never a word of me, Not though my shoulder's chafed so
  terribly.

  HER. But have you not a shoal of little songsters,
  Tragedians by the myriad, who can chatter
  A furlong faster than Euripides?

  DIO. Those be mere vintage-leavings, jabberers, choirs
  Of swallow-broods, degraders of their art,
  Who get one chorus, and are seen no more,
  The Muses' love once gained. But O my friend,
  Search where you will, you'll never find a true
  Creative genius, uttering startling things.

  HER. Creative? how do you mean?

  DIO. I mean a man Who'll dare some novel venturesome conceit,
  _Air, Zeus's chamber_, or _Time's foot_, or this,
  _'Twas not my mind that swore: my tongue committed
  A little perjury on its own account._

  HER. You like that style?

  DIO. Like it? I dote upon it.

  HER. I vow it's ribald nonsense, and you know it.

  DIO. "Rule not my mind": you've got a house to mind.

  HER. Really and truly though 'tis paltry stuff.

  DIO. Teach me to dine!

  XAN. But never a word of me.

  analysis: `
  The god Dionysus, dismayed by the poor quality of Athenian tragic poets after Euripides' death, decides to travel to Hades with his slave Xanthias to bring Euripides back. This opening scene shows them beginning their journey, complaining about the burdens (both literal and comedic), and seeking travel advice from Heracles, who has been to the underworld before.

  AEACUS. Who's there?

  DIO. I, Heracles the strong!

  AEAC. O, you most shameless desperate ruffian, you!
  O, villain, villain, arrant vilest villain!
  Who seized our Cerberus by the throat, and fled,
  And ran, and rushed, and bolted, haling off
  The dog, my charge! But now I've got thee fast.
  So close the Styx's inky-hearted rock,
  The blood-bedabbled peak of Acheron
  Shall hem thee in: the hell-hounds of Cocytus
  Prowl round thee; whilst the hundred-headed Asp
  Shall rive thy heart-strings: the Tartesian Lamprey,
  Prey on thy lungs: and those Tithrasian Gorgons
  Mangle and tear thy kidneys, mauling them,
  Entrails and all, into one bloody mash.
  I'll speed a running foot to fetch them hither.

  XAN. Hallo! what now?

  DIO. I've done it: call the god.

  XAN. Get up, you laughing-stock; get up directly, Before you're seen.

  DIO. What, _I_ get up? I'm fainting. Please dab a sponge of water on my
  heart.

  XAN. Here!

  DIO. Dab it, you.

  XAN. Where? O, ye golden gods, Lies your heart THERE?

  DIO. It got so terrified
  It fluttered down into my stomach's pit.

  XAN. Cowardliest of gods and men!

  DIO. The cowardliest? I? What I, who asked you for a sponge, a thing
  A coward never would have done!

  XAN. What then?

  DIO. A coward would have lain there wallowing;
  But I stood up, and wiped myself withal.

  XAN. Poseidon! quite heroic.

  DIO. 'Deed I think so. But weren't _you_ frightened at those dreadful
  threats And shoutings?

  XAN, Frightened? Not a bit. I cared not.

  DIO. Come then, if you're so _very_ brave a man,
  Will you be I, and take the hero's club
  And lion's skin, since you're so monstrous plucky?
  And I'll be now the slave, and bear the luggage.

  XAN. Hand them across. I cannot choose but take them.
  And now observe the Xanthio-heracles
  If I'm a coward and a sneak like you.

  DIO. Nay, you're the rogue from Melite's own self.
  And I'll pick up and carry on the traps.

  MAID. O welcome, Heracles! come in, sweetheart.
  My Lady, when they told her, set to work,
  Baked mighty loaves, boiled two or three tureens
  Of lentil soup, roasted a prime ox whole,
  Made rolls and honey-cakes. So come along.

  XAN. (Declining.) You are too kind.

  MAID. I will not let you go. I will not LET you! Why, she's stewing
  slices Of juicy bird's-flesh, and she's making comfits, And tempering
  down her richest wine. Come, dear, Come along in.

  XAN. (Still declining.) Pray thank her.

  MAID. O you're jesting, I shall not let you off: there's such a lovely
  Flute-girl all ready, and we've two or three Dancing-girls also.

  XAN. Eh! what! Dancing-girls?

  MAID. Young budding virgins, freshly tired and trimmed.
  Come, dear, come in. The cook was dishing up
  The cutlets, and they are bringing in the tables.

  XAN. Then go you in, and tell those dancing-girls
  Of whom you spake, I'm coming in
  Myself. Pick up the traps, my lad, and follow me.

  DIO. Hi! stop! you're not in earnest, just because I dressed you up, in
  fun, as Heracles? Come, don't keep fooling, Xanthias, but lift
  And carry in the traps yourself.

  XAN. Why! what! You are never going to strip me of these togs
  You gave me!

  DIO. Going to? No, I'm doing it now.
  Off with that lion-skin.

  XAN. Bear witness all
  The gods shall judge between us.

  DIO. Gods indeed! Why how could _you_ (the vain and foolish thought!)
  A slave, a mortal, act Alcmena's son?

  XAN. All right then, take them; maybe, if God will,
  You'll soon require my services again.

    CHOR. This is the part of a dexterous clever
    Man with his wits about him ever,
    One who has travelled the world to see;
    Always to shift, and to keep through all
    Close to the sunny side of the wall;
    Not like a pictured block to be,
    Standing always in one position;
    Nay but to veer, with expedition,
    And ever to catch the favouring breeze,
    This is the part of a shrewd tactician,
    This is to be a--THERAMENES!
    DIO. Truly an exquisite joke 'twould be,
    Him with a dancing girl to see,
    Lolling at ease on Milesian rugs;
    Me, like a slave, beside him standing,
    Aught that he wants to his lordship handing;
    Then as the damsel fair he hugs,
    Seeing me all on fire to embrace her,
    He would perchance (for there's no man baser),
    Turning him round like a lazy lout,
    Straight on my mouth deliver a facer,
    Knocking my ivory choirmen out.

  HOSTESS. O Plathane! Plathane! Here's that naughty man,
  That's he who got into our tavern once,
  And ate up sixteen loaves.

  PLATHANE. O, so he is! The very man.

  XAN. Bad luck for somebody!

  HOS. O and, besides, those twenty bits of stew,
  Half-obol pieces.

  XAN. Somebody's going to catch it!

  HOS. That garlic too.

  DIO. Woman, you're talking nonsense. You don't know what you're saying.

  HOS. O, you thought I shouldn't know you with your buskins on!
  Ah, and I've not yet mentioned all that fish,
  No, nor the new-made cheese: he gulped it down,
  Baskets and all, unlucky that we were.
  And when I just alluded to the price,
  He looked so fierce, and bellowed like a bull.

  XAN. Yes, that's his way: that's what he always does.

  HOS. O, and he drew his sword, and seemed quite mad.

  PLA. O, that he did.

  HOS. And terrified us so
  We sprang up to the cockloft, she and I.
  Then out he hurled, decamping with the rugs.

  XAN. That's his way too; but something must be done.

  HOS. Quick, run and call my patron Cleon here!

  PLA. O, if you meet him, call Hyperbolus! We'll pay you out to-day.

  HOS. O filthy throat, O how I'd like to take a stone, and hack
  Those grinders out with which you chawed my wares.

  analysis: `
  Having reached Hades, Dionysus (initially disguised as Heracles) and Xanthias encounter the fearsome gatekeeper Aeacus, leading to panic, a rapid costume swap, and further comedic confusion involving tempting offers and angry underworld residents accusing the current Heracles-impersonator (whether Dionysus or Xanthias) of past misdeeds.

  AESCH. My wrath is hot at this vile mischance, and my spirit revolts at
  the thought that I
  Must bandy words with a fellow like _him_: but lest he should vaunt
  that I can't reply--
  Come, tell me what are the points for which a noble poet our praise
  obtains.

  EUR. For his ready wit, and his counsels sage, and because the citizen
  folk he trains
  To be better townsmen and worthier men.

  AESCH. If then you have done the very reverse,
  Found noble-hearted and virtuous men, and altered them, each and all,
  for the worse,
  Pray what is the need you deserve to get?

  DIO. Nay, ask not _him_. He deserves to die.

  AESCH. For just consider what style of men he received from me, great
       six-foot-high
  Heroical souls, who never would blench from a townsman's duties in
       peace or war;
  Not idle loafers, or low buffoons, or rascally scamps such as now they
       are.
  But men who were breathing spears and helms, and the snow-white plume
       in its crested pride
  The greave, and the dart, and the warrior's heart in its seven-fold
       casing of tough bull-hide.

  DIO. He'll stun me, I know, with his armoury-work; this business is
  going from bad to worse.

  EUR. And how did you manage to make them so grand, exalted, and brave
  with your wonderful verse?

  DIO. Come, Aeschylus, answer, and don't stand mute in your self-willed
  pride and arrogant spleen.

  AESCH. A drama I wrote with the War-god filled.

  DIO. Its name?

  AESCH. 'Tis the "Seven against Thebes" that I mean. Which who so
  beheld, with eagerness swelled to rush to the battlefield there and
  then.

  DIO. O that was a scandalous thing you did! You have made the Thebans
       mightier men,
  More eager by far for the business of war.
  Now, therefore, receive this punch on the head.

  AESCH. Ah, _ye_ might have practised the same yourselves, but ye turned
       to other pursuits instead.
  Then next the "Persians" I wrote, in praise of the noblest deed that
       the world can show,
  And each man longed for the victor's wreath, to fight and to vanquish
       his country's foe.

  DIO. I was pleased, I own, when I heard their moan for old Darius,
       their great king, dead;
  When they smote together their hands, like this, and _Evir alake_ the
       Chorus said.

  AESCH. Aye, such are the poet's appropriate works: and just consider
       how all along
  From the very first they have wrought you good, the noble bards, the
       masters of song.
  First, Orpheus taught you religious rites, and from bloody murder to
       stay your hands:
  Musaeus healing and oracle lore; and Hesiod all the culture of lands,
  The time to gather, the time to plough. And gat not Homer his glory
       divine
  By singing of valour, and honour, and right, and the sheen of the
       battle-extended line,
  The ranging of troops and the arming of men?

  DIO. O ay, but he didn't teach _that_, I opine,
  To Pantacles; when he was leading the show I couldn't imagine what he
       was at,
  He had fastened his helm on the top of his head, he was trying to
       fasten his plume upon that.

  AESCH. But others, many and brave, he taught, of whom was Lamachus,
       hero true;
  And thence my spirit the impress took, and many a lion-heart chief I
       drew,
  Parocluses, Teucers, illustrious names; for I fain the citizen-folk
       would spur
  To stretch themselves to _their_ measure and height, when-ever the
       trumpet of war they hear.
  But Phaedras and Stheneboeas? No! no harlotry business deformed my
       plays.
  And none can say that ever I drew a love sick woman in all my days.

  EUR. For _you_ no lot or portion had got in Queen Aphrodite.

  AESCH. Thank Heaven for that.
  But ever on you and yours, my friend, the mighty goddess mightily sat;
  Yourself she cast to the ground at last.

  DIO. O ay, that came uncommonly pat.
  You showed how cuckolds are made, and lo, you were struck yourself by
       the very same fate.

  EUR. But say, you cross-grained censor of mine, how _my_ Stheneboeas
  could harm the state.

  AESCH. Full many a noble dame, the wife of a noble citizen, hemlock
       took,
  And died, unable the shame and sin of your Bellerophonscenes to brook.

  EUR. Was then, I wonder, the tale I told of Phaedra's passionate love
  untrue?

  AESCH. Not so: but tales of incestuous vice the sacred poet should hide
       from view,
  Nor ever exhibit and blazon forth on the public stage to the public
       ken.
  For boys a teacher at school is found, but we, the poets, are teachers
       of men.
  We are BOUND things honest and pure to speak.

  EUR. And to speak great Lycabettuses, pray,
  And massive blocks of Parnassian rocks, is _that_ things honest and
       pure to say?
  In human fashion we ought to speak.

  AESCH. Alas, poor witling, and can't you see
  That for mighty thoughts and heroic aims, the words themselves
       must appropriate be?
  And grander belike on the ear should strike the speech of heroes and
       godlike powers,
  Since even the robes that invest their limbs are statelier, grander
       robes than ours.
  Such was _my_ plan: but when _you_ began, you spoilt and degraded it
       all.

  EUR. How so?

  AESCH. Your kings in tatters and rags you dressed, and brought them on,
       a beggarly show,
  To move, forsooth, our pity and ruth.

  EUR. And what was the harm, I should like to know.

  AESCH. No more will a wealthy citizen now equip for the state a galley
  of war. He wraps his limbs in tatters and rags, and whines _he is poor,
  too poor by far_.

  DIO. But under his rags he is wearing a vest, as woolly and soft as a
       man could wish.
  Let him gull the state, and he's off to the mart; an eager, extravagant
       buyer of fish.

  AESCH. Moreover to prate, to harangue, to debate, is now the ambition
       of all in the state.
  Each exercise-ground is in consequence found deserted and empty: to
       evil repute
  Your lessons have brought our youngsters, and taught our sailors to
       challenge, discuss, and refute
  The orders they get from their captains and yet, when _I_ was alive,
       I protest that the knaves
  Knew nothing at all, save for rations' to call, and to sing "Rhyppapae"
       as they pulled through the waves.

  DIO. And bedad to let fly from their sterns in the eye of the fellow
       who tugged at the undermost oar,
  And a jolly young messmate with filth to besmirch, and to land for a
       filching adventure ashore; But now they harangue, and dispute, and
       won't row, And idly and aimlessly float to and fro.

  AESCH. Of what ills is he NOT the creator and cause?
  Consider the scandalous scenes that he draws,
  His bawds, and his panders, his women who give
       Give birth in the sacredest shrine,
  Whilst others with brothers are wedded and bedded,
       And others opine
  That "not to be living" is truly "to live."
  And therefore our city is swarming to-day
  With clerks and with demagogue-monkeys, who play
  Their jackanape tricks at all times, in all places,
  Deluding the people of Athens; but none
  Has training enough in athletics to run
       With the torch in his hand at the races.
  `,
  analysis: `
  A formal contest is underway in Hades, judged by Dionysus, to determine whether Aeschylus or Euripides is the superior tragic poet and thus worthy of returning to Athens. In this part of the debate (the agon), Aeschylus launches his defense, arguing that his plays instilled virtue and patriotism, directly contrasting his grand style with what he perceives as Euripides' degrading and socially harmful realism.
