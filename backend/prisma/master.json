      "intro": "Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) was an American naturalist, essayist, poet, and philosopher. A leading transcendentalist, he is best known for his book *Walden*, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay \"Civil Disobedience\", an argument for disobedience to an unjust state. His writings on nature and his philosophy of simple, conscientious living have had a profound impact on environmentalism and political thought, inspiring figures from Gandhi to Martin Luther King Jr.",

          "introduction": "\"On the Duty of Civil Disobedience\" is an essay by American transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau, first published in 1849. In it, Thoreau argues that individuals should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that they have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Written partly in response to his imprisonment for refusing to pay taxes that supported the Mexican-American War and slavery, the essay is a foundational text advocating for nonviolent resistance and has profoundly influenced figures and movements from Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. to various civil rights and anti-war protests.",

              "content": "I heartily accept the motto,\n\nThat government is best which governs least;\n\nand I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe\n\nThat government is best which governs not at all;\n\nand when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The objections which have been brought against a standing army, and they are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be brought against a standing government. The standing army is only an arm of the standing government. The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.\n\nThis American government,\n\nwhat is it but a tradition, though a recent one, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but each instant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitality and force of a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will. It is a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves; and, if ever they should use it in earnest as a real one against each other, it will surely split. But it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must have some complicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy that idea of government which they have. Governments show thus how successfully men can be imposed on, even impose on themselves, for their own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow; yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way. _It_ does not keep the country free. _It_ does not settle the West. _It_ does not educate. The character inherent in the American people has done all that has been accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government had not sometimes got in its way. For government is an expedient, by which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has been said, when it is most expedient, the governed are most let alone by it.",
              "analysis": "This opening snippet lays the foundation for Thoreau's argument, beginning with the famous assertion that the best government is one that governs least, ideally not at all. He characterizes government as merely an 'expedient,' often inefficient and prone to abuse, comparing it to a standing army. Thoreau argues that the achievements attributed to the American government are actually due to the character of the American people, suggesting that government often hinders rather than helps progress. This sets the stage for his critique of state authority and the call for individual moral judgment."

              "content": "But, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but _at once_ a better government. Let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect, and that will be one step toward obtaining it.\n\nAfter all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule, is not because they are most likely to be in the right, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they are physically the strongest. But a government in which the majority rule in all cases can not be based on justice, even as far as men understand it. Can there not be a government in which the majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong, but conscience?\n\nMust the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience, then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume, is to do at any time what I think right. It is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation _with_ a conscience. Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice. A common and natural result of an undue respect for the law is, that you may see a file of soldiers,\n\nmarching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, aye, against their common sense and consciences.\n\nThe mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies. They are the standing army, and the militia, jailers, constables, _posse comitatus_, &c. In most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well. Such command no more respect than men of straw, or a lump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs. Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens. Others, as most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and office-holders, serve the state chiefly with their heads; and, as they rarely make any moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the devil, without _intending_ it, as God. A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense, and _men_, serve the State with their consciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the most part; and they are commonly treated by it as enemies.",
              "analysis": "In this pivotal section, Thoreau directly challenges the concept of majority rule, arguing that it is based on physical strength, not justice. He asserts the supremacy of individual conscience over the law, famously stating that men should be 'men first, and subjects afterward.' He critiques the 'undue respect for the law' which turns individuals, even well-intentioned ones, into agents of injustice. He contrasts those who serve the state blindly like machines with those few who serve with their consciences, highlighting how the latter are often treated as enemies by the state. This snippet encapsulates his call for individuals to prioritize moral right over legal obligation."

              "title": "My Prison Experience",
              "content": "I have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put into a jail once on this account, for one night; and, as I stood considering the walls of solid stone, two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron grating which strained the light, I could not help being struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me as if I were mere flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. I wondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to, and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way. I saw that, if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen, there was a still more difficult one to climb or break through, before they could get to be as free as I was. I did not for a moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax. They plainly did not know how to treat me, but behaved like persons who are underbred. In every threat and in every compliment there was a blunder; for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that stone wall. I could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations, which followed them out again without let or hindrance, and _they_ were really all that was dangerous. As they could not reach me, they had resolved to punish my body; just as boys, if they cannot come at some person against whom they have a spite, will abuse his dog. I saw that the State was half-witted, that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons, and that it did not know its friends from its foes, and I lost all my remaining respect for it, and pitied it.\n\nThus the state never intentionally confronts a man's sense, intellectual or moral, but only his body, his senses. It is not armed with superior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength. I was not born to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us see who is the strongest. What force has a multitude? They only can force me who obey a higher law than I. They force me to become like themselves. I do not hear of _men_ being _forced_ to live this way or that by masses of men. What sort of life were that to live? When I meet a government which says to me, \"Your money or your life,† why should I be in haste to give it my money? It may be in a great strait, and not know what to do: I cannot help that. It must help itself; do as I do. It is not worth the while to snivel about it.",
              "analysis": "This snippet recounts Thoreau's personal experience of being jailed for refusing to pay the poll tax. He reflects on the futility and foolishness of the state's attempt to imprison his physical body when his true self, his thoughts and conscience, remain free and unconfined. He sees the state's action as a clumsy, unintelligent response to his principled stand, driven by physical force rather than moral or intellectual authority. This experience solidifies his view of the state as weak and unintelligent when confronted with the power of individual integrity and higher principles."

              "content": "But I shall perhaps best convey to the reader an idea of the entire\nperversion of thought which exists among this extraordinary people, by\ndescribing the public trial of a man who was accused of pulmonary\nconsumption—an offence which was punished with death until quite\nrecently. It did not occur till I had been some months in the country,\nand I am deviating from chronological order in giving it here; but I\nhad perhaps better do so in order that I may exhaust this subject\nbefore proceeding to others. Moreover I should never come to an end\nwere I to keep to a strictly narrative form, and detail the infinite\nabsurdities with which I daily came in contact.\n\nThe prisoner was placed in the dock, and the jury were sworn much as in\nEurope; almost all our own modes of procedure were reproduced, even to\nthe requiring the prisoner to plead guilty or not guilty. He pleaded\nnot guilty, and the case proceeded. The evidence for the prosecution\nwas very strong; but I must do the court the justice to observe that\nthe trial was absolutely impartial. Counsel for the prisoner was\nallowed to urge everything that could be said in his defence: the line\ntaken was that the prisoner was simulating consumption in order to\ndefraud an insurance company, from which he was about to buy an\nannuity, and that he hoped thus to obtain it on more advantageous\nterms. If this could have been shown to be the case he would have\nescaped a criminal prosecution, and been sent to a hospital as for a\nmoral ailment. The view, however, was one which could not be reasonably\nsustained, in spite of all the ingenuity and eloquence of one of the\nmost celebrated advocates of the country. The case was only too clear,\nfor the prisoner was almost at the point of death, and it was\nastonishing that he had not been tried and convicted long previously.\nHis coughing was incessant during the whole trial, and it was all that\nthe two jailors in charge of him could do to keep him on his legs until\nit was over.\n\nThe summing up of the judge was admirable. He dwelt upon every point\nthat could be construed in favour of the prisoner, but as he proceeded\nit became clear that the evidence was too convincing to admit of doubt,\nand there was but one opinion in the court as to the impending verdict\nwhen the jury retired from the box. They were absent for about ten\nminutes, and on their return the foreman pronounced the prisoner\nguilty. There was a faint murmur of applause, but it was instantly\nrepressed. The judge then proceeded to pronounce sentence in words\nwhich I can never forget, and which I copied out into a note-book next\nday from the report that was published in the leading newspaper. I must\ncondense it somewhat, and nothing which I could say would give more\nthan a faint idea of the solemn, not to say majestic, severity with\nwhich it was delivered. The sentence was as follows:-\n\n\"Prisoner at the bar, you have been accused of the great crime of\nlabouring under pulmonary consumption, and after an impartial trial\nbefore a jury of your countrymen, you have been found guilty. Against\nthe justice of the verdict I can say nothing: the evidence against you\nwas conclusive, and it only remains for me to pass such a sentence upon\nyou, as shall satisfy the ends of the law. That sentence must be a very\nsevere one. It pains me much to see one who is yet so young, and whose\nprospects in life were otherwise so excellent, brought to this\ndistressing condition by a constitution which I can only regard as\nradically vicious; but yours is no case for compassion: this is not\nyour first offence: you have led a career of crime, and have only\nprofited by the leniency shown you upon past occasions, to offend yet\nmore seriously against the laws and institutions of your country. You\nwere convicted of aggravated bronchitis last year: and I find that\nthough you are now only twenty-three years old, you have been\nimprisoned on no less than fourteen occasions for illnesses of a more\nor less hateful character; in fact, it is not too much to say that you\nhave spent the greater part of your life in a jail.\n\n\"It is all very well for you to say that you came of unhealthy parents,\nand had a severe accident in your childhood which permanently\nundermined your constitution; excuses such as these are the ordinary\nrefuge of the criminal; but they cannot for one moment be listened to\nby the ear of justice. I am not here to enter upon curious metaphysical\nquestions as to the origin of this or that—questions to which there\nwould be no end were their introduction once tolerated, and which would\nresult in throwing the only guilt on the tissues of the primordial\ncell, or on the elementary gases. There is no question of how you came\nto be wicked, but only this—namely, are you wicked or not? This has\nbeen decided in the affirmative, neither can I hesitate for a single\nmoment to say that it has been decided justly. You are a bad and\ndangerous person, and stand branded in the eyes of your\nfellow-countrymen with one of the most heinous known offences.",
              "analysis": "This snippet vividly portrays Erewhon's central satirical concept: the criminalization of illness and misfortune, contrasting sharply with the treatment of actual crime as a disease. The judge's speech is a masterpiece of inverted logic, demonstrating the arbitrary and often cruel nature of societal judgment when applied through a distorted moral lens, blaming the victim for circumstances beyond their control like genetic predisposition or childhood accident."

              "content": "Now I had already collected that the mercantile affairs of the\nErewhonians were conducted on a totally different system from our own;\nI had, however, gathered little hitherto, except that they had two\ndistinct commercial systems, of which the one appealed more strongly to\nthe imagination than anything to which we are accustomed in Europe,\ninasmuch as the banks that were conducted upon this system were\ndecorated in the most profuse fashion, and all mercantile transactions\nwere accompanied with music, so that they were called Musical Banks,\nthough the music was hideous to a European ear.\n\nAs for the system itself I never understood it, neither can I do so\nnow: they have a code in connection with it, which I have not the\nslightest doubt that they understand, but no foreigner can hope to do\nso. One rule runs into, and against, another as in a most complicated\ngrammar, or as in Chinese pronunciation, wherein I am told that the\nslightest change in accentuation or tone of voice alters the meaning of\na whole sentence. Whatever is incoherent in my description must be\nreferred to the fact of my never having attained to a full\ncomprehension of the subject.\n\nSo far, however, as I could collect anything certain, I gathered that\nthey have two distinct currencies, each under the control of its own\nbanks and mercantile codes. One of these (the one with the Musical\nBanks) was supposed to be _the_ system, and to give out the currency in\nwhich all monetary transactions should be carried on; and as far as I\ncould see, all who wished to be considered respectable, kept a larger\nor smaller balance at these banks. On the other hand, if there is one\nthing of which I am more sure than another, it is that the amount so\nkept had no direct commercial value in the outside world; I am sure\nthat the managers and cashiers of the Musical Banks were not paid in\ntheir own currency. Mr. Nosnibor used to go to these banks, or rather\nto the great mother bank of the city, sometimes but not very often. He\nwas a pillar of one of the other kind of banks, though he appeared to\nhold some minor office also in the musical ones. The ladies generally\nwent alone; as indeed was the case in most families, except on state\noccasions.\n\nI had long wanted to know more of this strange system, and had the\ngreatest desire to accompany my hostess and her daughters. I had seen\nthem go out almost every morning since my arrival and had noticed that\nthey carried their purses in their hands, not exactly ostentatiously,\nyet just so as that those who met them should see whither they were\ngoing. I had never, however, yet been asked to go with them myself.\n\nIt is not easy to convey a person's manner by words, and I can hardly\ngive any idea of the peculiar feeling that came upon me when I saw the\nladies on the point of starting for the bank. There was a something of\nregret, a something as though they would wish to take me with them, but\ndid not like to ask me, and yet as though I were hardly to ask to be\ntaken. I was determined, however, to bring matters to an issue with my\nhostess about my going with them, and after a little parleying, and\nmany inquiries as to whether I was perfectly sure that I myself wished\nto go, it was decided that I might do so.",
              "analysis": "Butler satirizes the British religious and banking systems through the Musical Banks. These institutions are outwardly grand and associated with a seemingly important currency, yet the currency holds no practical value. This reflects a society that pays lip service to spiritual or traditional values while conducting its real affairs based on a different, pragmatic system, highlighting hypocrisy and the disconnect between appearance and reality."

A few miserable individuals might linger, but even these in a\nyear or two would become worse than monkeys. Man's very soul is due to\nthe machines; it is a machine-made thing: he thinks as he thinks, and\nfeels as he feels, through the work that machines have wrought upon\nhim, and their existence is quite as much a _sine quâ non_ for his, as\nhis for theirs. This fact precludes us from proposing the complete\nannihilation of machinery, but surely it indicates that we should\ndestroy as many of them as we can possibly dispense with, lest they\nshould tyrannise over us even more completely.\n\n\"True, from a low materialistic point of view, it would seem that those\nthrive best who use machinery wherever its use is possible with profit;\nbut this is the art of the machines—they serve that they may rule. They\nbear no malice towards man for destroying a whole race of them provided\nhe creates a better instead; on the contrary, they reward him liberally\nfor having hastened their development. It is for neglecting them that\nhe incurs their wrath, or for using inferior machines, or for not\nmaking sufficient exertions to invent new ones, or for destroying them\nwithout replacing them; yet these are the very things we ought to do,\nand do quickly; for though our rebellion against their infant power\nwill cause infinite suffering, what will not things come to, if that\nrebellion is delayed?",
              "analysis": "This excerpt from the 'Book of the Machines' presents a radical argument: that machines are not merely tools but evolving organisms that could one day surpass humanity. It highlights humanity's deep dependence on technology, suggesting that machines already 'rule' by making survival impossible without them. This foreshadows a future where humans become subservient, serving the machines that were originally created to serve them, a surprisingly prescient theme."

To blaspheme the earth is now the\ndreadfulest sin, and to rate the heart of the unknowable higher than the\nmeaning of the earth!\n\nOnce the soul looked contemptuously on the body, and then that contempt\nwas the supreme thing:\n\n--the soul wished the body meagre, ghastly, and\nfamished. Thus it thought to escape from the body and the earth.\n\nOh, that soul was itself meagre, ghastly, and famished; and cruelty was\nthe delight of that soul!\n\nBut ye, also, my brethren, tell me: What doth your body say about\nyour soul? Is your soul not poverty and pollution and wretched\nself-complacency?\n\nVerily, a polluted stream is man. One must be a sea, to receive a\npolluted stream without becoming impure.\n\nLo, I teach you the Superman: he is that sea; in him can your great\ncontempt be submerged.\n\nWhat is the greatest thing ye can experience? It is the hour of great\ncontempt. The hour in which even your happiness becometh loathsome unto\nyou, and so also your reason and virtue.\n\nThe hour when ye say: \"What good is my happiness! It is poverty and\npollution and wretched self-complacency. But my happiness should justify\nexistence itself!†\n\nThe hour when ye say: \"What good is my reason! Doth it long for\nknowledge as the lion for his food? It is poverty and pollution and\nwretched self-complacency!†\n\nThe hour when ye say: \"What good is my virtue! As yet it hath not made\nme passionate. How weary I am of my good and my bad! It is all poverty\nand pollution and wretched self-complacency!†\n\nThe hour when ye say: \"What good is my justice! I do not see that I am\nfervour and fuel. The just, however, are fervour and fuel!†\n\nThe hour when ye say: \"What good is my pity! Is not pity the cross on\nwhich he is nailed who loveth man? But my pity is not a crucifixion.†\n\nHave ye ever spoken thus? Have ye ever cried thus? Ah! would that I had\nheard you crying thus!\n\nIt is not your sin—it is your self-satisfaction that crieth unto\nheaven; your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven!\n\nWhere is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where is the frenzy\nwith which ye should be inoculated?\n\nLo, I teach you the Superman: he is that lightning, he is that frenzy!—\n\nWhen Zarathustra had thus spoken, one of the people called out: \"We have\nnow heard enough of the rope-dancer; it is time now for us to see him!†\n\nAnd all the people laughed at Zarathustra. But the rope-dancer, who\nthought the words applied to him, began his performance.\n\n4.\n\nZarathustra, however, looked at the people and wondered. Then he spake\nthus:\n\nMan is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman—a rope over\nan abyss.\n\nA dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a\ndangerous trembling and halting.\n\nWhat is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is\nlovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.\n\nI love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they\nare the over-goers.\n\nI love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and\narrows of longing for the other shore.\n\nI love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going\ndown and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that\nthe earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive.\n\nI love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in\norder that the Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own\ndown-going.\n\nI love him who laboureth and inventeth, that he may build the house for\nthe Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, and plant: for thus\nseeketh he his own down-going.\n\nI love him who loveth his virtue: for virtue is the will to down-going,\nand an arrow of longing.\n\nI love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but wanteth to\nbe wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walketh he as spirit over the\nbridge.\n\nI love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for\nthe sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more.\n\nI love him who desireth not too many virtues. One virtue is more of a\nvirtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one's destiny to cling\nto.\n\nI love him whose soul is lavish, who wanteth no thanks and doth not give\nback: for he always bestoweth, and desireth not to keep for himself.\n\nI love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour, and who then\nasketh: \"Am I a dishonest player?†—for he is willing to succumb.\n\nI love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his deeds, and\nalways doeth more than he promiseth: for he seeketh his own down-going.\n\nI love him who justifieth the future ones, and redeemeth the past ones:\nfor he is willing to succumb through the present ones.\n\nI love him who chasteneth his God, because he loveth his God: for he\nmust succumb through the wrath of his God.\n\nI love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may succumb\nthrough a small matter: thus goeth he willingly over the bridge.\n\nI love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth himself, and all\nthings are in him: thus all things become his down-going.\n\nI love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus is his\nhead only the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth his\ndown-going.\n\nI love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark\ncloud that lowereth over man: they herald the coming of the lightning,\nand succumb as heralds.\n\nLo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud:\nthe lightning, however, is the SUPERMAN.—\n\n5.\n\nWhen Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked at the people,\nand was silent. \"There they stand,† said he to his heart; \"there they\nlaugh: they understand me not; I am not the mouth for these ears.\n\nMust one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their\neyes? Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers? Or do\nthey only believe the stammerer?\n\nThey have something whereof they are proud. What do they call it, that\nwhich maketh them proud? Culture, they call it; it distinguisheth them\nfrom the goatherds.\n\nThey dislike, therefore, to hear of 'contempt' of themselves. So I will\nappeal to their pride.\n\nI will speak unto them of the most contemptible thing: that, however, is\nTHE LAST MAN!†\n\nAnd thus spake Zarathustra unto the people:\n\nIt is time for man to fix his goal. It is time for man to plant the germ\nof his highest hope.\n\nStill is his soil rich enough for it. But that soil will one day be\npoor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow\nthereon.\n\nAlas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of\nhis longing beyond man—and the string of his bow will have unlearned to\nwhizz!\n\nI tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing\nstar. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.\n\nAlas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any\nstar. Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no\nlonger despise himself.\n\nLo! I show you THE LAST MAN.\n\n\"What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?†—so\nasketh the last man and blinketh.\n\nThe earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man\nwho maketh everything small. His species is ineradicable like that of\nthe ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.\n\n\"We have discovered happiness†—say the last men, and blink thereby.",
              "analysis": "This foundational passage introduces Zarathustra's core teaching: the concept of the Superman (Übermensch) as the goal for humanity to strive towards. It positions man as a transitional stage, a 'rope stretched between the animal and the Superman.' The passage starkly contrasts the aspiring individual, the 'over-goer' and 'down-goer' who sacrifices himself for the future meaning of the earth, with the 'Last Man.' The Last Man represents the ultimate degradation of humanity into comfortable, unambitious mediocrity, characterized by smallness and a lack of self-contempt, which Nietzsche saw as the frightening outcome of stagnant values. It also introduces the theme of the 'death of God' and the call to remain true to the earth."

              "analysis": "From the influential third part, this snippet directly challenges the softness and yielding Zarathustra perceives in his contemporaries. It posits hardness, likening it to the diamond, as a necessary virtue for creators and those aiming to overcome themselves. The call to 'Become Hard!' is a rejection of passive submission and an embrace of the active will required to shape the future and inscribe new values. This passage culminates in a poetic invocation of the Will, seeking not small victories but the ultimate, inexorable triumph over the self, symbolizing the readiness for the transformative moment of the 'great noontide.'"

Ah, that his best is so very\nsmall!†\n\nThe great disgust at man—IT strangled me and had crept into my throat:\nand what the soothsayer had presaged: \"All is alike, nothing is worth\nwhile, knowledge strangleth.†\n\nA long twilight limped on before me, a fatally weary, fatally\nintoxicated sadness, which spake with yawning mouth.\n\n\"Eternally he returneth, the man of whom thou art weary, the small\nman†—so yawned my sadness, and dragged its foot and could not go to\nsleep.\n\nA cavern, became the human earth to me; its breast caved in; everything\nliving became to me human dust and bones and mouldering past.\n\nMy sighing sat on all human graves, and could no longer arise: my\nsighing and questioning croaked and choked, and gnawed and nagged day\nand night:\n\n—\"Ah, man returneth eternally!

And\nthe eternal return also of the smallest man!—that was my disgust at all\nexistence!\n\nAh, Disgust! Disgust! Disgust!—Thus spake Zarathustra, and sighed and\nshuddered; for he remembered his sickness. Then did his animals prevent\nhim from speaking further.\n\n\"Do not speak further, thou convalescent!†—so answered his animals,\n\"but go out where the world waiteth for thee like a garden.\n\nGo out unto the roses, the bees, and the flocks of doves!

And\nwhen the sound also want songs, then want they other songs than the\nconvalescent.†\n\n—\"O ye wags and barrel-organs, do be silent!† answered Zarathustra, and\nsmiled at his animals. \"How well ye know what consolation I devised for\nmyself in seven days!\n\nThat I have to sing once more—THAT consolation did I devise for myself,\nand THIS convalescence: would ye also make another lyre-lay thereof?†\n\n—\"Do not talk further,† answered his animals once more; \"rather, thou\nconvalescent, prepare for thyself first a lyre, a new lyre!\n\nFor behold, O Zarathustra!

              "analysis": "This extensive passage from 'The Convalescent' encapsulates the difficult and profound doctrine of the Eternal Recurrence. Zarathustra recounts his physical and spiritual illness brought on by the 'great disgust' at the smallness of man and the terrifying prospect of the 'eternal return of the smallest man.' His animals, representing his wisdom and pride, then articulate the full scope of the teaching: the cyclical nature of existence where everything recurs infinitely, down to the smallest detail. This doctrine is presented as Zarathustra's unique and heavy fate to teach, requiring him to affirm and love every aspect of life, thereby overcoming the nihilistic despair that the idea initially provoked."

A seminal work of late Victorian literature, it is considered a classic of the Gothic and philosophical genres, as well as a key text of the aestheticism movement. The story follows the titular character, Dorian Gray, a handsome young man whose beauty is captured in a portrait. Under the influence of Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian becomes preoccupied with youth and beauty, leading him to make a Faustian bargain where his portrait ages and records his sins while he remains perpetually young and beautiful. The novel explores themes of morality, hedonism, art, and the corrupting influence of vanity and excess, challenging the social and moral conventions of the time.",

              "content": "The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and\nconceal the artist is art's aim. The critic is he who can translate\ninto another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful\nthings.\n\nThe highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\nThose who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without\nbeing charming. This is a fault.\n\nThose who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the\ncultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom\nbeautiful things mean only beauty.\n\nThere is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well\nwritten, or badly written. That is all.\n\nThe nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing\nhis own face in a glass.\n\nThe nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban\nnot seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of\nthe subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in\nthe perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove\nanything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has\nethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable\nmannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express\neverything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an\nart. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the\npoint of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the\nmusician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor's craft is the\ntype. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the\nsurface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their\nperil. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.\nDiversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,\ncomplex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with\nhimself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he\ndoes not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that\none admires it intensely.\n\nAll art is quite useless.\n\nOSCAR WILDE",
              "analysis": "Wilde's famous preface serves as a manifesto for Aestheticism, asserting the autonomy of art from morality. It contains key aphorisms like 'There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book' and 'All art is quite useless,' which challenge Victorian sensibilities and lay the philosophical groundwork for the novel's exploration of beauty, pleasure, and ethics."

He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry's last\nremark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,\n\"Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it\nawfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?\"\n\nLord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. \"Am I to go, Mr. Gray?\"  he\nasked.\n\n\"Oh, please don't, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky\nmoods, and I can't bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell\nme why I should not go in for philanthropy.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a\nsubject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly\nshall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don't\nreally mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your\nsitters to have some one to chat to.\"\n\nHallward bit his lip. \"If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.\nDorian's whims are laws to everybody, except himself.\"\n\nLord Henry took up his hat and gloves. \"You are very pressing, Basil,\nbut I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the\nOrleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon\nStreet. I am nearly always at home at five o'clock. Write to me when\nyou are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.\"\n\n\"Basil,\" cried Dorian Gray, \"if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,\ntoo. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is\nhorribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask\nhim to stay. I insist upon it.\"\n\n\"Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,\" said Hallward,\ngazing intently at his picture. \"It is quite true, I never talk when I\nam working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious\nfor my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.\"\n\n\"But what about my man at the Orleans?\"\n\nThe painter laughed. \"I don't think there will be any difficulty about\nthat. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,\nand don't move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry\nsays. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single\nexception of myself.\"\n\nDorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek\nmartyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom\nhe had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a\ndelightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few\nmoments he said to him, \"Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\nHenry? As bad as Basil says?\"\n\n\"There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is\nimmoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does\nnot think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His\nvirtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as\nsins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an\nactor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is\nself-development. To realize one's nature perfectly—that is what each\nof us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have\nforgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one's\nself. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe\nthe beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone\nout of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,\nwhich is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\nreligion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—\",",
              "analysis": "In this pivotal exchange from Chapter II, Lord Henry begins to corrupt Dorian Gray with his hedonistic philosophy. He dismisses traditional morality and advocates for radical self-fulfillment, urging Dorian to embrace sensation and resist fear. This speech plants the seed of vanity and the desire for eternal youth in Dorian's mind, fundamentally altering his character and setting the stage for the subsequent tragedy."

Surely it was not still so horrible as it\nhad been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel\nevery sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil had\nalready gone away. He would go and look.\n\nHe took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the\ndoor, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face\nand lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and\nthe hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror\nto him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.\n\nHe went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and\ndragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and\nindignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that in the\neyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of\nthe hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome—more loathsome, if\npossible, than before—and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed\nbrighter, and more like blood newly spilled. Then he trembled. Had it\nbeen merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the\ndesire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking\nlaugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things\nfiner than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the\nred stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a\nhorrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the\npainted feet, as though the thing had dripped—blood even on the hand\nthat had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to\nconfess? To give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt\nthat the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would\nbelieve him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.\nEverything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned\nwhat had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.\nThey would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his\nduty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement.\nThere was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well\nas to heaven. Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had\ntold his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of\nBasil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty\nMerton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he\nwas looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing\nmore in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At\nleast he thought so. But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing\nmore. Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the\nmask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self.\nHe recognized that now.\n\nBut this murder—was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to be\nburdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was only\none bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself—that was\nevidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it had\ngiven him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late he had\nfelt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When he had been\naway, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon\nit. It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had\nmarred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him. Yes, it\nhad been conscience. He would destroy it.\n\nHe looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He\nhad cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was\nbright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill\nthe painter's work, and all that that meant. It would kill the past,\nand when that was dead, he would be free. It would kill this monstrous\nsoul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He\nseized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.\n\nThere was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its\nagony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.\nTwo gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked\nup at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman and\nbrought him back. The man rang the bell several times, but there was no\nanswer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all\ndark. After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and\nwatched.\n\n\"Whose house is that, Constable?\" asked the elder of the two gentlemen.\n\n\"Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir,\" answered the policeman.\n\nThey looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of\nthem was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.\n\nInside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad domestics\nwere talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying\nand wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as death.\n\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the\nfootmen and crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They\ncalled out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force\nthe door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony. The\nwindows yielded easily—their bolts were old.\n\nWhen they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait\nof their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his\nexquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in\nevening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled,\nand loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings\nthat they recognized who it was.",
              "analysis": "The dramatic conclusion of the novel. Dorian attempts to redeem himself by performing a good deed and checks the portrait for a change, only to find it uglier than before, bearing the mark of hypocrisy. In a final desperate act, he attempts to destroy the portrait, which has become the symbol of his soul and conscience. Instead, the act destroys him, transferring the corruption and age back to his body while the painting is restored to its original beauty. It highlights the novel's themes of art, morality, and the consequences of a life devoted solely to pleasure and avoiding responsibility."

              "analysis": "Pablo Neruda's \"Tonight I Can Write The Saddest Lines\" (Poem 20 from Twenty Love Poems and a Desperate Song) is a poignant exploration of lost love, memory, and the enduring pain of separation. The poem is structured around the recurring refrain \"Tonight I can write the saddest lines,\" grounding the speaker in the present moment of despair and reflection.\n\nThe central theme is the contrast between the vibrant, shared past and the desolate present. The speaker vividly recalls intimate moments under the starry sky, emphasizing physical closeness and mutual (though sometimes uncertain) love. These memories are juxtaposed with the stark reality of her absence, which makes the immense night feel even emptier. The loss is not just intellectual but deeply physical and emotional, felt in the soul, sight, and heart's futile search.\n\nNeruda's style is characterized by its directness, lyrical beauty, and use of natural imagery to reflect emotional states. The starry night, the wind, the dew, and the trees are not mere backdrop but active participants or mirrors of the speaker's feelings. The language is simple yet evocative, employing repetition and contrast (e.g., \"I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too\" vs. \"She loved me, sometimes I loved her too\"; \"Love is so short, forgetting is so long\"). The fluctuation between certainty and doubt (\"I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her\"; \"I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her\") captures the complex, unresolved nature of grief and attachment.\n\nThe significance of the poem lies in its universal portrayal of heartbreak. It speaks to the enduring power of memory, the difficulty of letting go, and the way the external world becomes infused with personal sorrow after a profound loss. The concluding lines, expressing a hope (or perhaps a plea) that this pain and these verses mark an end to the suffering caused by her absence, provide a sense of closure, even if the underlying ache remains. It is a quintessential expression of romantic melancholy that has resonated with readers for generations."

              "content": "My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father\n's house and my native country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or\nof aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon\nadventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in\nundertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were\nall either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the\nmiddle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life,\nwhich he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the\nworld, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries\nand hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of\nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy\nof the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness\nof this state by this one thing\n—viz. that this was the state of life\nwhich all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the\nmiserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they\nhad been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and\nthe great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the\nstandard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor\nriches.\n\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of\nlife were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that\nthe middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so\nmany vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they\nwere not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of\nbody or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and\nextravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries,\nand mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon\nthemselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the\nmiddle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all\nkind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a\nmiddle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health,\nsociety, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were\nthe blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men\nwent silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of\nit, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not\nsold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed\ncircumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor\nenraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of\nambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently\nthrough the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without\nthe bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day\n's\nexperience to know it more sensibly.\n\nAfter this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate\nmanner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into\nmiseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to\nhave provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my\nbread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly\ninto the station of life which he had just been recommending to me; and\nthat if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere\nfate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to\nanswer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against\nmeasures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would\ndo very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he\ndirected, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to\ngive me any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I\nhad my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same\nearnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars,\nbut could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the\narmy, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to\npray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this\nfoolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have leisure\nhereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might\nbe none to assist in my recovery.\n\nI observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly\nprophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so\nhimself\n—I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully,\nespecially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he\nspoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so\nmoved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so\nfull he could say no more to me.",

It highlights the themes of youthful rebellion against parental guidance and the idea of predestined misfortune, setting the stage for Crusoe's later suffering as a consequence of rejecting this sensible, moderate path."

              "content": "I was surprised one morning by seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the\nisland, and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of my\nsight. The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and\nknowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more in a boat,\nI could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures to\nattack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay still in my castle,\nperplexed and discomforted. However, I put myself into the same position\nfor an attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for\naction, if anything had presented. Having waited a good while, listening\nto hear if they made any noise, at length, being very impatient, I set\nmy guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the\nhill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however, that my head did\nnot appear above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any\nmeans. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective glass, that they\nwere no less than thirty in number; that they had a fire kindled, and\nthat they had meat dressed. How they had cooked it I knew not, or what\nit was; but they were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous\ngestures and figures, their own way, round the fire.\n\nWhile I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two\nmiserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were\nlaid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of\nthem immediately fall; being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or\nwooden sword, for that was their way; and two or three others were at\nwork immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other\nvictim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for\nhim. In that very moment this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at\nliberty and unbound, Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he\nstarted away from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the\nsands, directly towards me; I mean towards that part of the coast where\nmy habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge,\nwhen I perceived him run my way; and especially when, as I thought, I\nsaw him pursued by the whole body: and now I expected that part of my\ndream was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in\nmy grove; but I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream, that the\nother savages would not pursue him thither and find him there. However,\nI kept my station, and my spirits began to recover when I found that\nthere was not above three men that followed him; and still more was I\nencouraged, when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in\nrunning, and gained ground on them; so that, if he could but hold out\nfor half-an-hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them\nall.\n\nThere was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentioned often\nin the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the\nship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor\nwretch would be taken there; but when the savage escaping came thither,\nhe made nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in,\nswam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran\nwith exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons came to\nthe creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the third could\nnot, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but\nwent no farther, and soon after went softly back again; which, as it\nhappened, was very well for him in the end. I observed that the two who\nswam were yet more than twice as strong swimming over the creek as the\nfellow was that fled from them. It came very warmly upon my thoughts,\nand indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant,\nand, perhaps, a companion or assistant; and that I was plainly called\nby Providence to save this poor creature's life. I immediately ran down\nthe ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they\nwere both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed before, and getting\nup again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards\nthe sea; and having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed myself\nin the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallowing aloud to him\nthat fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much frightened\nat me as at them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and,\nin the meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed; then\nrushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of\nmy piece. I was loath to fire, because I would not have the rest hear;\nthough, at that distance, it would not have been easily heard, and\nbeing out of sight of the smoke, too, they would not have known what to\nmake of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued him\nstopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced towards him: but\nas I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was\nfitting it to shoot at me: so I was then obliged to shoot at him first,\nwhich I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who\nfled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen and\nkilled, as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of\nmy piece that he stood stock still, and neither came forward nor went\nbackward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come\non. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come forward, which he\neasily understood, and came a little way; then stopped again, and then\na little farther, and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he\nstood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to\nbe killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come to\nme, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think of;\nand he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps,\nin token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and\nlooked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at length\nhe came close to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground,\nand laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my\nfoot upon his head; this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my\nslave for ever.",
              "analysis": "The sudden appearance of cannibals and the subsequent rescue of a prisoner who would become known as Friday is a pivotal moment. It introduces the theme of the 'noble savage' and the complexities of master-slave relationships, viewed through a colonial lens. Crusoe's act of saving Friday is presented as divinely prompted, reflecting his growing faith and providing him with the longed-for human companionship, albeit one based on servitude."

              "content": "On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. bridge.\\n\\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\\n\\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.\\n\\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely aware of his fears.\\n\\n\"I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these trifles,† he thought, with an odd smile. \"Hm... yes, all is in a man's hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that's an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking too much. It's because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing. I've learned to chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is _that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It's simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.†\\n\\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man's already overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man's refined face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted food.\\n\\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man's heart, that, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: \"Hey there, German hatter† bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall round hat from Zimmerman's, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\\n\\n\"I knew it,† he muttered in confusion, \"I thought so! That's the worst of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them a clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it's just such trifles that always ruin everything....†",
              "analysis": "This opening snippet introduces the protagonist, Raskolnikov, and establishes his state of mind and physical environment. His extreme poverty, isolation, and hypochondria are immediately apparent, contrasted with his handsome appearance. The oppressive heat and stench of St. Petersburg are vividly depicted, contributing to his frayed nerves. Most significantly, the snippet reveals his nascent, disturbing plan (\"a thing like that\") and his chilling self-reflection on courage, fear, and the idea that seemingly insignificant 'trifles' could jeopardize everything."

              "content": "\"I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I know him.... I was very much interested.†\\n\\n\"I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime.†\\n\\n\"Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness. Very, very original, but... it was not that part of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are certain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the law is not for them.†\\n\\nRaskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his idea.\\n\\n\"What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the influence of environment?† Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.\\n\\n\"No, not exactly because of it,† answered Porfiry. \"In his article all men are divided into 'ordinary' and 'extraordinary.' Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because, don't you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they are extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?†\\n\\n\"What do you mean? That can't be right?† Razumihin muttered in bewilderment.\\n\\nRaskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where they wanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.\\n\\n\"That wasn't quite my contention,† he began simply and modestly. \"Yet I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like, perfectly so.† (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) \"The only difference is that I don't contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an 'extraordinary' man has the right... that is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity). You say that my article isn't definite; I am ready to make it as clear as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have been in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either, if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law--were of use to their cause. It's remarkable, in fact, that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving some new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less, of course. Otherwise it's hard for them to get out of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is what they can't submit to, from their very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that.",
              "analysis": "This pivotal passage reveals the philosophical core of Raskolnikov's motivations: his 'extraordinary man' theory. As explained to the astute investigator Porfiry Petrovitch, this theory posits a natural division of humanity into 'ordinary' and 'extraordinary' individuals. While the former must obey existing laws, the latter, being capable of uttering 'a new word' or contributing to humanity's progress, possess an inherent right to transgress moral and legal boundaries if necessary for their cause. This snippet highlights Raskolnikov's attempt to rationalize his crime, comparing himself to historical figures like Napoleon, and underscores the intellectual pride driving his actions."

              "content": "The second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was difficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the ward.\\n\\nOne evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On waking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the distance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone. Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and moved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was discharged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.\\n\\nHe was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that her illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her, Sonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better, that she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and see him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.\\n\\nAgain it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o'clock, he went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only three of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank. In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black specksthe nomads' tents. There there was freedom, there other men were living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed. Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.\\n\\nHow it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come....",
              "analysis": "This passage in the Epilogue marks the turning point in Raskolnikov's regeneration. Despite his initial intellectual arrogance and lack of conventional remorse in prison, his prolonged illness and the unwavering presence of Sonia gradually break through his hardened pride. The scene by the riverbank, with the backdrop of the vast Siberian landscape, culminates in his emotional surrender, kneeling and weeping at Sonia's feet. This act signifies his acceptance of suffering and love, the abandonment of his isolating theory, and the beginning of his path towards spiritual renewal facilitated by Sonia's unconditional devotion."

              "content": "In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic. Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.\n\nFrom the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place was bewitched by a High German doctor, during the early days of the settlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and visions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in the air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare, with her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols.\n\nThe dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.\n\nSuch is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.",
              "analysis": "This passage establishes the iconic setting of Sleepy Hollow, defining its atmosphere as one of peculiar tranquility mixed with pervasive superstition. Irving uses vivid descriptions of the landscape and the Dutch inhabitants to create a sense of timeless isolation. The introduction of the Headless Horseman legend roots the story in local folklore and immediately sets a tone of gothic mystery and foreboding, foreshadowing the supernatural events to come."

In this enterprise, however, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass, and walls of adamant to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was confined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way to the centre of a Christmas pie; and then the lady gave him her hand as a matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties and impediments; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every portal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.\n\nAmong these, the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood. He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with short curly black hair, and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air of fun and arrogance. From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the nickname of BROM BONES, by which he was universally known. He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock fights; and, with the ascendancy which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal.

Irving humorously contrasts Ichabod's ambition with the idealized quest of a knight-errant, highlighting the real-world obstacles posed by Katrina's coquettish nature and her robust suitor, Brom Bones. The description of Brom Bones establishes him as the formidable, distinctly physical rival, setting up the central conflict of the story as a battle between Ichabod's cunning (and perhaps supernatural beliefs) and Brom's strength and local influence."

              "content": "As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle; he thought his whistle was answered; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches. As he approached a little nearer, he thought he saw something white, hanging in the midst of the tree: he paused and ceased whistling but, on looking more narrowly, perceived that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid bare. Suddenly he heard a groan--his teeth chattered, and his knees smote against the saddle: it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon another, as they were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.\n\nAbout two hundred yards from the tree, a small brook crossed the road, and ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known by the name of Wiley's Swamp. A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over this stream. On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood, a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape-vines, threw a cavernous gloom over it. To pass this bridge was the severest trial. It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate André was captured, and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him. This has ever since been considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.\n\nAs he approached the stream, his heart began to thump; he summoned up, however, all his resolution, gave his horse half a score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge; but instead of starting forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against the fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles and alder bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward, snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge, with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he beheld something huge, misshapen and towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.",
              "analysis": "This passage captures the peak of Ichabod's terror during his ride home. Irving masterfully builds suspense through sounds and sights misinterpreted by Ichabod's fearful imagination, culminating in the encounter with the mysterious figure at the haunted bridge. The detailed description of Ichabod's panic and his horse's reluctance emphasizes his physical awkwardness and cowardice. The sudden appearance of the 'huge, misshapen and towering' figure sets the stage for the famous climax, highlighting the pervasive atmosphere of dread and the blending of psychological fear with potential supernatural reality that defines the story."

Few of her poems were published during her lifetime, and those that were often altered to conform to conventional poetic rules.  After her death, her younger sister Lavinia discovered nearly 1800 poems hidden in a chest. Published posthumously, Dickinson's work was initially met with skepticism due to its unconventional style – unique punctuation (dashes), irregular capitalization, and slant rhyme. However, her inventive form and profound exploration of themes like death, nature, immortality, and self-identity gradually gained critical acclaim, establishing her as one of the most important figures in American poetry.",

It presents Death not as a fearsome figure, but as a courteous guide taking the speaker on a leisurely carriage ride through stages of life, culminating in an arrival at eternity. Its significance lies in its profound meditation on mortality, time, and the afterlife, challenging conventional religious and cultural perspectives on death with a unique blend of domestic imagery and cosmic scope.",

              "analysis": "Emily Dickinson's \"Because I Could Not Stop for Death\" is one of her most celebrated and profound explorations of mortality and eternity. The poem personifies Death not as a fearsome Grim Reaper, but as a courteous, almost gentle suitor who arrives in a carriage to take the speaker on a journey. This surprising portrayal immediately sets the tone for a quiet, unhurried transition from life to the afterlife.\n\nThe journey itself becomes an allegory for the passage through life. The carriage ride is slow and deliberate (\"He knew no haste\"), emphasizing that death is an inevitable, unhurried destination. The speaker has already relinquished her earthly concerns (\"My labor and my leisure too\"), prepared for this final journey. The sights they pass - the schoolyard bustling with children, the fields of ripe grain, the setting sun - represent different stages and aspects of life: childhood, maturity/harvest, and the end of the day/life.\n\nAs the journey progresses, the atmosphere shifts. The shift from the setting sun to the \"quivering and Chill\" dews marks the transition from the warmth of life to the cold of death. The speaker notes her attire - \"Gossamer\" gown and \"Tulle\" tippet - suggesting she was not dressed for cold, implying death came unexpectedly or perhaps she shed her earthly garments for something ethereal. The slowing down is emphasized in the fourth stanza, where the sun passes *them*, reversing the perspective and highlighting their detachment from the world's ongoing movement.\n\nThe destination is a house \"that seemed / A Swelling of the Ground\" with \"The Roof was scarcely visible\" and the \"Cornice – in the Ground.\" This is a thinly veiled description of a grave or burial mound, portrayed with Dickinson's characteristic indirectness and focus on earthly details. It's the speaker's final resting place, her temporary home before eternity.\n\nThe final stanza makes a dramatic leap in time. Centuries have passed since that carriage ride began, yet the speaker perceives this vast expanse of time as shorter than the single day she first understood the eternal nature of their journey. This concluding thought challenges conventional notions of time and mortality, suggesting that in the context of eternity, earthly life and even post-mortem centuries are fleeting. The poem ultimately reconfigures death from a terrifying end into a gentle, even polite, transition towards an endless, incomprehensible state of being. Dickinson's unique style, marked by her distinctive use of dashes, capitalization, and slant rhyme (e.g., \"Civility\"/\"Immortality\"), contributes significantly to the poem's unique rhythm and contemplative mood, forcing the reader to pause and consider the profound subject matter in a fresh, unconventional light."

              "title": "Shaw's Epilogue: Why Eliza Married Freddy",
              "content": "As our own instincts are not appealed to by her conclusion, let us see whether we cannot discover some reason in it. When Higgins excused his indifference to young women on the ground that they had an irresistible rival in his mother, he gave the clue to his inveterate old-bachelordom. The case is uncommon only to the extent that remarkable mothers are uncommon. If an imaginative boy has a sufficiently rich mother who has intelligence, personal grace, dignity of character without harshness, and a cultivated sense of the best art of her time to enable her to make her house beautiful, she sets a standard for him against which very few women can struggle, besides effecting for him a disengagement of his affections, his sense of beauty, and his idealism from his specifically sexual impulses. This makes him a standing puzzle to the huge number of uncultivated people who have been brought up in tasteless homes by commonplace or disagreeable parents, and to whom, consequently, literature, painting, sculpture, music, and affectionate personal relations come as modes of sex if they come at all. The word passion means nothing else to them; and that Higgins could have a passion for phonetics and idealize his mother instead of Eliza, would seem to them absurd and unnatural.\n\nNevertheless, when we look round and see that hardly anyone is too ugly or disagreeable to find a wife or a husband if he or she wants one, whilst many old maids and bachelors are above the average in quality and culture, we cannot help suspecting that the disentanglement of sex from the associations with which it is so commonly confused, a disentanglement which persons of genius achieve by sheer intellectual analysis, is sometimes produced or aided by parental fascination.\n\nNow, though Eliza was incapable of thus explaining to herself Higgins's formidable powers of resistance to the charm that prostrated Freddy at the first glance, she was instinctively aware that she could never obtain a complete grip of him, or come between him and his mother (the first necessity of the married woman). To put it shortly, she knew that for some mysterious reason he had not the makings of a married man in him, according to her conception of a husband as one to whom she would be his nearest and fondest and warmest interest. Even had there been no mother-rival, she would still have refused to accept an interest in herself that was secondary to philosophic interests. Had Mrs. Higgins died, there would still have been Milton and the Universal Alphabet. Landor's remark that to those who have the greatest power of loving, love is a secondary affair, would not have recommended Landor to Eliza. Put that along with her resentment of Higgins's domineering superiority, and her mistrust of his coaxing cleverness in getting round her and evading her wrath when he had gone too far with his impetuous bullying, and you will see that Eliza's instinct had good grounds for warning her not to marry her Pygmalion.\n\nAnd now, whom did Eliza marry? For if Higgins was a predestinate old bachelor, she was most certainly not a predestinate old maid. Well, that can be told very shortly to those who have not guessed it from the indications she has herself given them.\n\nAlmost immediately after Eliza is stung into proclaiming her considered determination not to marry Higgins, she mentions the fact that young Mr. Frederick Eynsford Hill is pouring out his love for her daily through the post. Now Freddy is young, practically twenty years younger than Higgins: he is a gentleman (or, as Eliza would qualify him, a toff), and speaks like one; he is nicely dressed, is treated by the Colonel as an equal, loves her unaffectedly, and is not her master, nor ever likely to dominate her in spite of his advantage of social standing. Eliza has no use for the foolish romantic tradition that all women love to be mastered, if not actually bullied and beaten. \"When you go to women,† says Nietzsche, \"take your whip with you.† Sensible despots have never confined that precaution to women: they have taken their whips with them when they have dealt with men, and been slavishly idealizing by the men over whom they have flourished the whip much more than by women. No doubt there are slavish women as well as slavish men; and women, like men, admire those that are stronger than themselves. But to admire a strong person and to live under that strong person's thumb are two different things. The weak may not be admired and hero-worshipped; but they are by no means disliked or shunned; and they never seem to have the least difficulty in marrying people who are too good for them. They may fail in emergencies; but life is not one long emergency: it is mostly a string of situations for which no exceptional strength is needed, and with which even rather weak people can cope if they have a stronger partner to help them out. Accordingly, it is a truth everywhere in evidence that strong people, masculine or feminine, not only do not marry stronger people, but do not show any preference for them in selecting their friends. When a lion meets another with a louder roar \"the first lion thinks the last a bore.† The man or woman who feels strong enough for two, seeks for every other quality in a partner than strength.\n\nThe converse is also true. Weak people want to marry strong people who do not frighten them too much; and this often leads them to make the mistake we describe metaphorically as \"biting off more than they can chew.† They want too much for too little; and when the bargain is unreasonable beyond all bearing, the union becomes impossible: it ends in the weaker party being either discarded or borne as a cross, which is worse. People who are not only weak, but silly or obtuse as well, are often in these difficulties.\n\nThis being the state of human affairs, what is Eliza fairly sure to do when she is placed between Freddy and Higgins? Will she look forward to a lifetime of fetching Higgins's slippers or to a lifetime of Freddy fetching hers? There can be no doubt about the answer. Unless Freddy is biologically repulsive to her, and Higgins biologically attractive to a degree that overwhelms all her other instincts, she will, if she marries either of them, marry Freddy.",
              "analysis": "From the epilogue, this snippet explains Shaw's deliberate choice for Eliza's future, explicitly rejecting the conventional romantic ending of her marrying Higgins. Shaw argues that Eliza chooses Freddy not out of passionate love (though he loves her), but because he offers her independence and equal partnership, unlike the domineering Higgins. He philosophizes on the nature of attraction, arguing that strong individuals often prefer weaker partners who don't challenge their dominance, while weaker individuals seek strength but also seek not to be overwhelmed. This challenges romantic ideals and emphasizes the practical and psychological realities of relationships and independence, particularly for women."

A yellow\ndressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild\nmorning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:\n\n—_Introibo ad altare Dei_.\n\nHalted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:\n\n—Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!\n\nSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about\nand blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the\nawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent\ntowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat\nand shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned\nhis arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking\ngurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light\nuntonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.\n\nBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the\nbowl smartly.\n\n—Back to barracks! he said sternly.\n\nHe added in a preacher's tone:\n\n—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul\nand blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One\nmoment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.\n\nBuck Mulligan mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair\noakpale hair stirring slightly.\n\n—God! he said quietly. Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet\nmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. _Epi oinopa\nponton_. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them\nin the original. _Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.\nCome and look.\n\nStephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked\ndown on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of\nKingstown.\n\n—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.\n\nHe turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's\nface.\n\n—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't\nlet me have anything to do with you.\n\n—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.\n\n—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother\nasked you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to\nthink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and\npray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....\n\nDrawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:\n\n—It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.\n\nBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him\nround the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he\nhad thrust them.\n\n—It's not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.\nGod knows you have more spirit than any of them.\n\nParried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The\ncold steel pen.",

I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.\n\n—Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.\n\nShe blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively\nand long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits\nnarrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to\nthe dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him,\npoured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.\n\n—Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.\n\nHe watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped\nthree times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they\ncan't mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or\nkind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.\n\nHe listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with\nthis drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for\na mutton kidney at Buckley's. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.\nBetter a pork kidney at Dlugacz's. While the kettle is boiling. She\nlapped slower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so\nrough? To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced\nround him. No.\n\nOn quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by\nthe bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter\nshe likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.\n\nHe said softly in the bare hall:\n\n—I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.\n\nAnd when he had heard his voice say it he added:\n\n—You don't want anything for breakfast?\n\nA sleepy soft grunt answered:\n\n—Mn.\n\nNo. She didn't want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,\nas she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.\nMust get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.\nForgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for\nit. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor's auction.\nGot a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At\nPlevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it. Still\nhe had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was\nfarseeing.\n\nHis hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat\nand his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback\npictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.\nThe sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's\nhigh grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White\nslip of paper. Quite safe.\n\nOn the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.\nIn the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky\nwardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He\npulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf\ndropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right\ntill I come back anyhow.\n\nHe crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number\nseventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. Be a\nwarm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black\nconducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn't go in\nthat light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as\nhe walked in happy warmth. Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our\ndaily but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.\nMakes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at\ndawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him.\nKeep it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a\nstrand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker\ntoo, old Tweedy's big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.\nWander through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of\ncarpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking\na coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented\nwith fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two.\nWell, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among\nthe pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees,\nsignal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches\nme from her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark\nlanguage. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet,\ncolour of Molly's new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of\nthose instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.\n\nProbably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track\nof the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself.\nWhat Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_\nleader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway\nbehind the bank of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch\nthat: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.\n\nHe approached Larry O'Rourke's. From the cellar grating floated up the\nflabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out\nwhiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the\nend of the city traffic. For instance M'Auley's down there: n. g. as\nposition. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular\nfrom the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.\n\nBaldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an\nad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my\nbold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching\nthe aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him\noff to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I'm going to\ntell you? What's that, Mr O'Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians,\ntheyd only be an eight o'clock breakfast for the Japanese.\n\nStop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor\nDignam, Mr O'Rourke.\n\nTurning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the\ndoorway:\n\n—Good day, Mr O'Rourke.\n\n—Good day to you.\n\n—Lovely weather, sir.\n\n—'Tis all that.\n\nWhere do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the\ncounty Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and\nbehold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then think\nof the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin\nwithout passing a pub. Save it they can't. Off the drunks perhaps. Put\ndown three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs\nand drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with\nthe town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we'll split the\njob, see?\n\nHow much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels\nof stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint\nJoseph's National school. Brats' clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps\nmemory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee\ndoubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At\ntheir joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.\n\nHe halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages,\npolonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened\nin his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,\npacked with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the\nlukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs' blood.\n\nA kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He\nstood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too,\ncalling the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a\npound and a half of Denny's sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous\nhips. Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New\nblood. No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on\nthe clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked\nskirt swings at each whack.\n\nThe ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with\nblotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.\n\nHe took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at\nKinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter\nsanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round\nit, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:\nread it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page\nrustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the\nbeasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the\nbreeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a\npalm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled\nswitches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his\nsenses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt\nswinging, whack by whack by whack.\n\nThe porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime\nsausages and made a red grimace.\n\n—Now, my miss, he said.\n\nShe tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.\n\n—Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,\nplease?\n\nMr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went\nslowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the\nmorning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood\noutside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He\nsighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted\ntoenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The\nsting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For\nanother: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles' Lane. They like\nthem sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the\nwood.\n\n—Threepence, please.\n\nHis hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.\nThen it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them\non the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,\ndisc by disc, into the till.\n\n—Thank you, sir. Another time.\n\nA speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze\nafter an instant. No: better not: another time.\n\n—Good morning, he said, moving away.\n\n—Good morning, sir.\n\nNo sign. Gone. What matter?\n\nHe walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:\nplanters' company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish\ngovernment and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel\nand construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.\nYou pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with\nolives, oranges, almonds or citrons.

              "analysis": "This snippet introduces Leopold Bloom and his stream of consciousness. It contrasts mundane domestic routine (breakfast preparation, cat) with his inner world of memories, desires, and exotic fantasies (Molly, Milly, the East, advertising schemes). It showcases Joyce's revolutionary interior monologue technique and establishes Bloom's gentle, humane, and somewhat solitary character."

His career as a playwright produced four classics, and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. Alongside Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre. Chekhov practiced as a medical doctor throughout most of his literary career: \"Medicine is my lawful wife\", he once said, \"and literature is my mistress.\" He died of tuberculosis.",

It depicts the hilarious confrontation between Elena Ivanovna Popova, a widow ostensibly devoted to perpetual mourning, and Grigory Smirnov, a boisterous creditor demanding payment from her late husband's estate. Their explosive argument, marked by insults and threats, unexpectedly leads to a declaration of love and a surprising resolution. The play is a brilliant example of Chekhov's skill in comedic writing, masterfully employing farce and sharp dialogue to explore the volatility of human emotions, the absurdity of conventional behavior, and the underlying passion beneath social facades. It remains one of his most popular short plays.",

He is best known for his epinicia, odes celebrating victors at the four great Panhellenic games: the Olympian, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian games. His work, though often fragmented, is characterized by its complex meter, lofty language, and celebration of aristocratic values, virtue (arete), and the glory achieved through divine favour and athletic prowess. While challenging to translate and interpret, his surviving odes provide invaluable insight into Greek religion, mythology, and the social values of the archaic and classical periods, significantly influencing later poets and scholars with their unique style and grandeur.",

Initially conceived as a parody of popular chivalric romances, the novel follows the adventures of Alonso Quijano, an hidalgo who loses his mind from reading too many chivalric tales and sets out as the knight-errant Don Quixote, accompanied by his pragmatic squire, Sancho Panza. The work masterfully blends elements of comedy, tragedy, and profound philosophical reflection, exploring themes of idealism versus pragmatism, reality versus illusion, and the nature of sanity. Its groundbreaking narrative techniques and complex character development had a lasting impact on the development of the novel genre.",

          "introduction": "\"In a Station of the Metro\" is a seminal poem by Ezra Pound, first published in 1913. As a key example of Imagism, it demonstrates the movement's core principles: direct treatment of the 'thing', whether subjective or objective; to use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation; and rhythm in sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of the metronome. The poem, only two lines long, captures a moment in the Paris Metro using vivid, concise imagery, famously comparing faces in a crowd to petals on a wet, black bough. Its brevity and intense focus on visual detail made it a manifesto for Imagist aesthetics and profoundly influenced 20th-century poetry by advocating for clarity, precision, and economy of language.",

      "intro": "Henry James was an American-British writer. He is regarded as one of the key figures of 19th-century literary realism. He spent much of his adult life in England and became a British citizen in 1915, a year before his death. James is known for his novels, novellas, and short stories that often explore themes of consciousness, perception, morality, and social class. His works frequently contrast characters from the Old World (Europe) and the New World (America), examining the clash of cultures. Notable works include \"The Portrait of a Lady\", \"The Wings of the Dove\", \"The Golden Bowl\", and the novella \"The Turn of the Screw\". His intricate prose style, marked by long sentences and complex psychological depth, influenced many later writers. His contribution to literary modernism and his psychological realism remain highly significant.",

His poetry starkly depicted the horrors of trench warfare and the realities of the Western Front, often employing vivid imagery and irony. His work, including famous poems like \"Dulce et Decorum Est\" and \"Anthem for Doomed Youth,\" offered a powerful counterpoint to the prevailing patriotic verse of the time. Killed in action just a week before the Armistice, Owen's powerful and poignant verse fundamentally changed the way war was perceived and written about in the 20th century, establishing him as a central figure in modern English literature and a voice for the soldiers' experience.",

It is considered a seminal work of war poetry and a key text in understanding the true horror of the First World War from a soldier's perspective.",

Flaubert's meticulous prose, psychological depth, and unflinching portrayal of provincial bourgeois life, female discontent, and societal hypocrisy made the novel both controversial upon publication (leading to an indecency trial) and immensely influential. It is considered a masterpiece and a crucial step in the development of the modern novel.",

The poem is notable for its complex structure, its use of multiple voices and languages, and its vast array of allusions to mythology, religion, literature, and history, reflecting the fragmented and alienated experience of the modern age. Despite its initial difficulty and controversy, its profound exploration of the human condition in a time of crisis has cemented its status as a powerful and influential work.",

      "intro": "Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) was an American essayist, lecturer, philosopher, and poet who led the transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century. Born in Boston, he was ordained a Unitarian minister but later resigned to pursue a career as a lecturer and writer. His essays, including 'Nature' and 'Self-Reliance,' champion individualism, freedom, and humanity's connection to the divine within nature. Emerson's work profoundly influenced American thought and literature, encouraging a uniquely American voice independent of European tradition and inspiring generations of writers and thinkers.",

          "introduction": "Nature is Ralph Waldo Emerson's foundational essay that outlines the core tenets of Transcendentalism. Published anonymously in 1836, it argues for a profound connection between humanity and the natural world, asserting that individuals can find spiritual truth and self-reliance through direct communion with nature rather than through intermediaries like organized religion or societal institutions. The work emphasizes intuition and the inherent goodness of both people and nature, serving as a cornerstone text for the American Transcendentalist movement and profoundly influencing subsequent American thought and literature.",

      "intro": "W. H. Auden (1907–1973) was a British-American poet, often considered one of the most influential and important writers of the 20th century. Known for his technical and stylistic diversity, he explored a wide range of themes including love, politics, citizenship, religion, and the relationship between humans and the natural world. His early work was marked by political and social concerns, particularly the rise of fascism, while his later poetry became increasingly religious and philosophical. Auden's legacy is defined by his prolific output, his ability to seamlessly blend formal verse with colloquial language, and his profound impact on modern poetry.",

Auden's \"Funeral Blues,\" officially known as \"Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,\" is a poignant and widely recognized poem exploring themes of profound grief and loss. Originally written for the play \"The Ascent of F6\" in 1936 as a satirical lament, it was later revised and published in Auden's 1940 collection \"Another Time\" as part of a sequence of four cabaret songs. Its enduring fame was cemented when it was read at the funeral in the popular 1994 film \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" resonating deeply with audiences for its raw expression of sorrow and the feeling that the world should cease in the face of personal tragedy. The poem uses simple yet powerful imagery to convey the overwhelming desolation experienced after the death of a loved one.",
